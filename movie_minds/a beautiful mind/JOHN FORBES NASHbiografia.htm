style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>'s father, also called John Forbes
Nash so we shall refer to him as John Nash Senior, was a native of Texas. John
Nash Senior was born in 1892 and had an unhappy childhood from which he escaped
when he studied electrical engineering at Texas Agricultural and Mechanical. After
military service in France during World War I, John Nash Senior lectured on
electrical engineering for a year at the University of Texas before joining the
Appalacian Power Company in Bluefield, West Virginia. John F Nash's mother,
Margaret Virginia Martin, was known as Virginia. She had a university
education, studying languages at the Martha Washington College and then at West
Virginia University. She was a school teacher for ten years before meeting John
Nash Senior, and the two were married on 6 September 1924. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Johnny Nash, as
he was called by his family, was born in Bluefield Sanatorium and baptised into
the Episcopal Church. He was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>... a
singular little boy, solitary and introverted ... </span></i><span lang=EN-GB
style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'>but he was brought up in a loving family surrounded by close relations
who showed him much affection. After a couple of years Johnny had a sister when
Martha was born. He seems to have shown a lot of interest in books when he was
young but little interest in playing with other children. It was not because of
lack of children that Johnny behaved in this way, for Martha and her cousins
played the usual childhood games cutting patterns out of books, playing
hide-and-seek in the attic, playing football. However while the others played
together Johnny played by himself with toy airplanes and matchbox cars. His
mother responded by enthusiastically encouraging Johnny's education, both by
seeing that he got good schooling and also by teaching him herself. Johnny's
father responded by treating him like an adult, giving him science books when
other parents might give their children colouring books. Johnny's teachers at
school certainly did not recognise his genius, and it would appear that he gave
them little reason to realise that he had extraordinary talents. They were more
conscious of his lack of social skills and, because of this, labelled him as
backward. Although it is easy to be wise after the event, it now would appear
that he was extremely bored at school. By the time he was about twelve years
old he was showing great interest in carrying out scientific experiments in his
room at home. It is fairly clear that he learnt more at home than he did at
school. Martha seems to have been a remarkably normal child while Johnny seemed
different from other children. She wrote later in life <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Johnny was
always different. [My parents] knew he was different. And they knew he was
bright. He always wanted to do thinks his way. Mother insisted I do things for
him, that I include him in my friendships. ... but I wasn't too keen on showing
off my somewhat odd brother. </span></i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'>His parents encouraged him to take part in social activities and he did
not refuse, but sports, dances, visits to relatives and similar events he
treated as tedious distractions from his books and experiments. Nash first
showed an interest in mathematics when he was about 14 years old. Quite how he
came to read </span><span style='color:white'><a

lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>'s <i>Men of mathematics</i>
is unclear but certainly this book inspired him. He tried, and succeeded, in
proving for himself results due to </span><span style='color:white'><a

lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> which Bell stated in
his book. The excitement that Nash found here was in contrast to the
mathematics that he studied at school which failed to interest him. He entered
Bluefield College in 1941 and there he took mathematics courses as well as
science courses, in particular studying chemistry which was a favourite topic. He
began to show abilities in mathematics, particularly in problem solving, but
still with hardly any friends and behaving in a somewhat eccentric manner, this
only added to his fellow pupils view of him as peculiar. He did not considered
a career in mathematics at this time, however, which is not surprising since it
was an unusual profession. Rather he assumed that he would study electrical
engineering and follow his father but he continued to conduct his own chemistry
experiments and was involved in making explosives which led to the death of one
of his fellow pupils. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Boredom and
simmering adolescent aggression led him to play pranks, occasionally ones with
a nasty edge.</span></i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'>He caricatured classmates he disliked with weird cartoons, enjoyed
torturing animals, and once tried to get his sister to sit in a chair he had
wired up with batteries. Nash won a scholarship in the George Westinghouse
Competition and was accepted by the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now
Carnegie-Mellon University) which he entered in June 1945 with the intention of
taking a degree in chemical engineering. Soon, however, his growing interest in
mathematics had him take courses on tensor calculus and relativity. There he
came in contact with </span><span style='color:white'><a

appointed as Head of the Mathematics Department and taught the relativity
course. </span><span style='color:white'><a

lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Synge</span></a></span><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> and the other
mathematics professors quickly recognised Nash's remarkable mathematical
talents and persuaded him to become a mathematics specialist. They realised that
he had the talent to become a professional mathematician and strongly
encouraged him. Nash quickly aspired to great things in mathematics. He took
the William Lowell Putnam Mathematics Competition twice but, although he did
well, he did not make the top five. It was a failure in Nash's eyes and one
which he took badly. The Putnam Mathematics Competition was not the only thing
going badly for Nash. Although his mathematics professors heaped praise on him,
his fellow students found him a very strange person. Physically he was strong
and this saved him from being bullied, but his fellow students took delight in
making fun of Nash who they saw as an awkward immature person displaying
childish tantrums. One of his fellow students wrote: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>He was a
country boy unsophisticated even by our standards. He behaved oddly, playing a
single chord on a piano over and over, leaving a melting ice cream cone melting
on top of his castoff clothing, walking on his roommate's sleeping body to turn
off the light.</span></i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:

<p><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Another wrote:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>And a third
fellow student wrote: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>We tormented
poor John. We were very unkind. We were obnoxious. We sensed he had a mental

<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'>He showed homosexual tendencies, climbing into bed with the other boys
who reacted by making fun of the fact that he was attracted to boys and
humiliated him. They played cruel pranks on him and he reacted by asking his
fellow students to challenge him with mathematics problems. He ended up doing
the homework of many of the students. Nash received a BA and an MA in
mathematics in 1948. By this time he had been accepted into the mathematics
programme at Harvard, Princeton, Chicago and Michigan. He felt that Harvard was
the leading university and so he wanted to go there, but on the other hand their
offer to him was less generous than that of Princeton. Nash felt that Princeton
were keen that he went there while he felt that his lack of success in the
Putnam Mathematics Competition meant that Harvard were less enthusiastic. He
took a while to make his decision, while he was encouraged by </span><span

but he seems to have avoided attending lectures. Usually those who decide not
to learn through lectures turn to books but this appears not to be so for Nash
who decided not to learn mathematics &quot;second-hand&quot; but rather to
develop topics himself. In many ways this approach was successful for it did
contribute to him developing into one of the most original of mathematicians
who would attack a problem in a totally novel way. In 1949, while studying for
his doctorate, he wrote a paper which 45 years later was to win a Nobel prize
for economics. During this period Nash established the mathematical principles
of game theory. P Ordeshook wrote: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The concept
of a Nash equilibrium n-tuple is perhaps the most important idea in
noncooperative game theory. ... Whether we are analysing candidates' election
strategies, the causes of war, agenda manipulation in legislatures, or the
actions of interest groups, predictions about events reduce to a search for and
description of equilibria. Put simply, equilibrium strategies are the things
that we predict about people.</span></i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;

<p><i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>He was
always full of mathematical ideas, not only on game theory, but in geometry and
topology as well. However, my most vivid memory of this time is of the many
games which were played in the common room. I was introduced to Go and
Kriegspiel, and also to an ingenious topological game which we called Nash in honor
of the inventor. </span></i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:

<p><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>In fact the
game &quot;Nash&quot; was almost identical to Hex which had been invented
independently by Piet Hein in Denmark. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Here are three comments
from fellow students:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Nash was out
of the ordinary. If he was in a room with twenty people, and they were talking,
if you asked an observer who struck you as odd it would have been Nash. It
wasn't anything he consciously did. It was his bearing. His aloofness. <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Nash was
totally spooky. He wouldn't look at you. he'd take a lot of time answering a
question. If he thought the question was foolish he wouldn't answer at all. He
had no affect. It was a mixture of pride and something else. He was so isolated
but there really was underneath it all a warmth and appreciation of people. <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p><i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>A lot of us
would discount what Nash said. ... I wouldn't want to listen. You didn't feel
comfortable with the person.</span></i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;

lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> advised him to go and
learn more physics. Apparently a physicist did publish a similar idea some
years later. In 1950 Nash received his doctorate from Princeton with a thesis
entitled <i><span style='background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow'>Non-cooperative
Games</span></i>. In the summer of that year he worked for the RAND Corporation
where his work on game theory made him a leading expert on the Cold War
conflict which dominated RAND's work. He worked there from time to time over
the next few years as the Corporation tried to apply game theory to military
and diplomatic strategy. Back at Princeton in the autumn of 1950 he began to
work seriously on pure mathematical problems. It might seem that someone who had
just introduced ideas which would, one day, be considered worthy of a Nobel
Prize would have no problems finding an academic post. However, Nash's work was
not seen at the time to be of outstanding importance and he saw that he needed
to make his mark in other ways. We should also note that it was not really a
move towards pure mathematics for he had always considered himself a pure
mathematician. He had already obtained results on manifolds and algebraic
varieties before writing his thesis on game theory. His famous theorem, that
any compact real manifold is diffeomorphic to a component of a real-algebraic
variety, was thought of by Nash as a possible result to fall back on if his
work on game theory was not considered suitable for a doctoral thesis. He said
in a recent interview: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>I developed
a very good idea in pure mathematics. I got what became Real Algebraic
Manifolds. I could have published that earlier, but it wasn't rushed to
publication. I took some time in writing it up. Somebody suggested that I was a
prodigy. Another time it was suggested that I should be called &quot;bug

different methods. The outstanding results which Nash had obtained in the
course of a few years put him into contention for a 1958 Fields' Medal but with
his work on parabolic and elliptic equations was still unpublished when the

style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> but mental illness destroyed his
career long before those decisions were made. During his time at MIT Nash began
to have personal problems with his life which were in addition to the social
difficulties he had always suffered. Colleagues said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Nash was
always forming intense friendships with men that had a romantic quality. He was
very adolescent, always with the boys. He was very experimental - mostly he
just kissed.</span></i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>He met Eleanor
Stier and they had a son, John David Stier, who was born on 19 June 1953. Eleanor
was a shy girl, lacking confidence, a little afraid of men, didn't want to be
involved. She found in Nash someone who was even less experienced than she was
and found that attractive. :<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Nash was
looking for emotional partners who were more interested in giving than
receiving, and Eleanor, was very much that sort.</span></i><span lang=EN-GB
style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Nash did not
want to marry Eleanor although she tried hard to persuade him. In the summer of
1954, while working for RAND, Nash was arrested in a police operation to trap
homosexuals. He was dismissed from RAND. One of Nash's students at MIT, Alicia
Larde, became friendly with him and by the summer of 1955 they were seeing each
other regularly. He also had a special friendship with a male graduate student
at this time Jack Bricker. Eleanor found out about Alicia in the spring of 1956
when she came to Nash's house and found him in bed with Alicia. Nash said to a
friend:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>My perfect
little world is ruined, my perfect little world is ruined.</span></i><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'>Alicia didn't seem too upset at discovering that Nash had a child with
Eleanor and deduced that since the affair had been going on for three years,
Nash was probably not serious about her. In 1956 Nash's parents found out about
his continuing affair with Eleanor and about his son John David Stier. The
shock may have contributed to the death of Nash's father soon after but even if
it did not Nash may have blamed himself. In February of 1957 Nash married
Alicia; by the autumn of 1958 she was pregnant but, a couple of months later
near the end of 1958, Nash's mental state became very disturbed. At a New
Year's Party Nash appeared at midnight dressed only with a nappy and a sash
with &quot;1959&quot; written on it. He spent most of the evening curled up,
like the baby he was dressed as, on his wife's lap. Some described his
behaviour as stranger than usual. On 4 January he was back at the university
and started to teach his game theory course. His opening comments to the class
were:- <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The question
occurs to me. Why are you here?</span></i><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;

<p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'>One student immediately dropped the course! Nash asked a graduate
student to take over his course and vanished for a couple of weeks. When he
returned he walked into the common room with a copy of the New York Times
saying that it contained encrypted messages from outer space that were meant
only for him. For a few days people thought he was playing an elaborate private
joke. </span><span style='color:white'><a

lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> was one of the first to
recognize that Nash's extreme eccentricities and personality problems were
actually symptoms of a medical disorder. After months of bizarre behaviour,
Alicia had her husband involuntarily hospitalised at McLean Hospital, a private
psychiatric hospital outside of Boston. Upon his release, Nash abruptly
resigned from M.I.T., withdrew his pension, and went to Europe, where he
intended to renounce his U.S. citizenship. Alicia left her newborn son with her
mother, and followed the ill Nash. She then had Nash deported - back to the
United States. After their return, the two settled in Princeton where Alicia
took a job. Nash's illness continued, transforming him into a frightening
figure. He spent most of his time hanging around on the Princeton campus,
talking about himself in the third person as Johann von Nassau, writing
nonsensical postcards and making phone calls to former colleagues. They
stoically listened to his endless discussions of numerology and world political
affairs. Her husband's worsening condition depressed Alicia more and more. In
January 1961 the despondent Alicia, John's mother, and his sister Martha made
the difficult decision to commit him to Trenton State Hospital in New Jersey
where he endured insulin-coma therapy, an aggressive and risky treatment, five
days a week for a month and a half. A long sad episode followed which included
periods of hospital treatment, temporary recovery, then further treatment. Alicia
divorced Nash in 1962. Nash spent a while with Eleanor and John David. In 1970
Alicia tried to help him taking him in as a boarder, but he appeared to be lost
to the world, removed from ordinary society, although he spent much of his time
in the Mathematics Department at Princeton. The book is highly recommended for
its moving account of Nash's mental sufferings. Slowly over many years Nash
recovered. He delivered a paper at the tenth World Congress of Psychiatry in
1996 describing his illness; it is reported in . He was described in 1958 as
the:- <o:p></o:p></span></p>
