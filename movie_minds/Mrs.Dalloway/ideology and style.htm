<p style='text-align:justify'><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.5pt;
color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Virginia Woolf is probably the greatest
avant-guard writer of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. She loved Proust, who had been
proposed to her by the Bloomsbury group, for his ability in the description,
transformation and psychological analysis of the characters, who were elusive
in their inwardness. She hated Joyce for his “whirls of<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>obscenity”. She practised an intense and
continue critical activity, that brought her to think about the problems of
literature and the reasons of her poetics. She compared her works with the
traditional English literature and she believed that the traditional novel of
the 19<sup>th</sup> century was suitable no more, because of the changes of the
society and of the man of her contemporary age. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>The voyage out </i>and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Night and
day</i> represented a challenge to the great realistic novel of Tolstoj: was
she able to handle the classic realistic tradition of the English novel? These
novels must be considered as two moments of the process of self-realization of
Virginia as a writer. During her illnesses and psychological diseases, she
always fought to build a strong artistic identity, by using her creativity.
From 1915 to 1922 she transformed herself in a real writer. Even if her first
novels were linked to the tradional literature she was already in great
conflict with herself. Virginia considered the plot of a novel as a vulgarity,
especially if it was captivating. Her first sperimental step can be found in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Jacob’s room</i>, where she decided to break
the plot. This novel was written in order to demonstrate the unknowability of
the principal character. She considered human beings as shadows who love
shadows and whose destiny is to vanish as shadows. We live thanks to fragments.
In 1920 Virginia Woolf developed her own vision of life and ego, which
determined the formal choice of the interior monologue, the fluidification of
the rigid realistic structure and the humanization of the characters, whose
inner-life could be more easily penetrated. The exterior appearance of people,
that is interested in the physical and social world, is responsible for the
concealment of the characters’ inwardness. In Virginia Woolf’s opinion, the
external shell of every ego, shaped by personal and familiar passions, was also
modified by the influences of Time and Experience. The border of ego is fluid
and inconstant, whereas the protagonists of the traditional realistic novel
were built on a quite superficial notion of the human ego. Virginia woolf’s
characters are rarely held by a precise profile, they are sorrounded by a sense
of inexplicability and mistery. The writer wanted to express continuity and
mutability of the individual identity at the same time ( <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>To the lighthouse, Mrs. Dalloway, The waves </i>). As in the works of
Joyce, whom Virginia Woolf continued to despise, the principal innovationsof
her novels are the interior monologue and the stream of consciousness , which
enabled her to explore memories, desires, dreams of her characters, who could
be observed in their external and interior appearance. This way of handling the
protagonists of her works was even deeper than that of Joyce. Whereas Joyce
examined the depths of the Es, she decided to avoid its muddy puddles, since
she did not like psychoanalysis. She never let her characters’ thoughts flow
out of control, she maintained logical and grammatical organization.H Her
technique was based on the fusion of streams of thought into a third-person,
past tense narrative. She gave the impression of simultaneous connections
between the inner and the outer world, the past and the present, speech and
silence. “Moments of being” are rare moments of insight during her characters’
daily lives when theycan see reality behind appearances. In <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Modern Fiction </i>Virginia Woolf says:<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><b><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Life escapes;
and perhaps without life nothing else is worth while. It is a confession of
vagueness to have to make use of such a figure as this, but we scarcely better
the matter by speaking, as critics are prone to do, of reality. Admitting the
vagueness which afflicts all criticism of novels, let us hazard the opinion
that for us at this moment the form of fiction most in vogue more often misses
than secures the thing we seek. Whether we call it life or spirit, truth or
reality, this, the essential thing, has moved off, or on, and refuses to be
contained any longer in such ill- fitting vestments as we provide.
Nevertheless, we go on perseveringly conscientiously, constructing our two and
thirty chapters after a design which more and more ceases to resemble the
vision in our minds. So much of the enormous labour of proving the solidity,
the likeness to life, of the story is not merely labour thrown away but labour
misplaced to the extent of obscuring and blotting out the light of the
conception. The writer seems constrained, not by his own free will but by some
powerful and unscrupulous tyrant who has him in thrall, to provide a plot, to
provide comedy, tragedy, love interest, and an air of probability embalming the
whole so impeccable that if all his figures were to come to life they would
find themselves dressed down to the last button of their coats in the fashion
of the hour. The tyrant is obeyed; the novel is done to a turn. But sometimes,
more and more often as time goes by, we suspect a momentary doubt, a spasm of
rebellion, as the pages themselves in the customary way. Is life like this?
Must novels be like this?<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><b><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Examine for a moment an ordinary mind on an ordinary
day. The mind receives a myriad impressions- trivial, fantastic, evanescent, or
engraved with the sharpness of steel. From all sides they come, an incessant
shower of innumerable atoms; and as they fall, as they shape themselves into
the life of Monday or Tuesday, the accent falls differently from of old; the
moment of importance came not here but there; so that, if a writer were a free
man and not a slave, if he could write what he chose, not what he must, if he
could base his work upon his own feeling and not upon convention, there would
be no plot, no comedy, no tragedy, no love interest or catastrophe in the
accepted style, and perhaps not a single button sewn on as the Bond Street
tailors would have it. Life is not a series of gig lamps symmetrically
arranged; life is a luminous halo, a semi-transparent envelope surrounding us
from the beginning of consciousness to the end. Is it not the task of the
novelist to convey this varying, this unknown and uncircumscribed spirit,
whatever aberration or com- plexity it may display, with as little mixture of
the alien and external as possible? We are not pleading merely for courage and
sincerity; we are suggesting that the proper stuff of fiction is a little other
than custom would have us believe it.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><b><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The proper stuff of fiction does not exist; everything
is the proper stuff of fiction, every feeling, every thought; every quality of
brain and spirit is drawn upon; no perception comes amiss. And if we can
imagine the art of fiction come alive and standing in our midst, she would undoubtedly
bid us break her and bully her, as well as honour and love her, for so her
youth is renewed and her sovereignty assured</span></b><span lang=EN-GB

<p style='text-align:justify'><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.5pt;
color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>In 1924 Virginia Woolf reached the highest
point of her rebellion against the traditional male novel and she became aware
of her poetical and lyrical female talent: she wrote in order to make real the
drawing hidden behind the appearances of everyday life through words. Every
human being belongs to this drawing: we are the words and the music of a work
of art represented by the world. She had been thinking about the character of
Clarissa Dalloway for several years. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mrs.
Dalloway </i>was an important point of Virginia’s career. It was the first
novel in which she used her whole female experience, without any kind of
inferiority complex. She used her sense of ecstasy towards life and her
awareness of the importance of every moment lived. In this novel she unveiled
her original way of narrating: the incessant impressionistic shower of
innumerable atoms on the human mind. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>To
the lighthouse </i>is considered her masterpiece, while in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Orlando </i>she broke the social link between sexual identity and role,
through a fantastic satire. In this novel Virginia Woolf described the life of
Orlando, a character inspired by the lesbian aristocrat Vita Sackville-West, in
order to defend the androgyny of human beings, our sexual ambiguity, the male
and female aspects that coexist in every person. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Orlando</i> was rich in irony and echoes from the English Elizabethan
literature onwards. Virginia Woolf supported the emancipation of women, she
told them to search for an economic independence and for a room of their own in
order to find the concentration to write. She exhorted them to write as women
but they had to remember that the artist’s mind is androgenic. The feminist
writer was born: she still suffered for her exclusion and oppression as a girl,
she hated the patriarcal system and she considered herself as a victim of this
kind of society. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The waves</i> is a novel
based on mental spaces, on recitatives or dramatic monologues. Everyone is
inseparable from the rest of mankind, everyone is a wave in the stream of life
and eternity. Virginia Woolf spoke about the sense of life, of time and
changes, of mortality. Only in the novel <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The
years,</i> the writer had to use facts, probably because of the impending
menace of the II WW, while in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Three
Guineas </i><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>she underlined the existence
of a female culture, different and separated from the male one. The exclusion
of women from the social and political life preserved them from corruption. For
this reason their diversity had to be transformed into a positive one.Virginia
Woolf is considered today as the “Spiritual mother” of the modern movement of
cultured women.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.5pt;
color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The images Virginia Woolf uses establish
her idea of true reality and reject a whole tradition of literature: they are
chosen so as to have an air of modernity, to seem intangible, vague and
shapeless. The evnts that traditionally make up a story are no longer
important. What matters is the impression they make on the characters who
experience them. In Woolf’s novels the omniscient narrator disappears and the
point of view shifts inside the characters’ minds throough flashbacks,
associations of ideas, and momentary impressions presented as a continuous
flux.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.5pt;

“impressionist” in her attempt to seize the impressions of the individual
consciousness, in the use of light and colours. Her use of words is almost
poetic; they are allusive and emotional. Rhyme, refrain and metaphore are the
main features of Woolf’s poetic style, together with fluidity; in other words
that quality of language which flows following the most intricate thoughts and
stretches to express the most intimate feelings.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

understood it was impossible to reproduce the complexity of the human mind
using traditional techniques, and looked for more suitable means of expression.
They adopted the interior monologue to represent, in a novel, the unspoken
activity of the mind before it is ordered in speech. Interior monologue is
often confused with the stream of consciousness, although they are quite
different. In fact the former is the verbal expression of a psychic phenomen,
while the latter is the psychic phenomenon itself. It is its immediacy which
distinguishes the internal monologue from both the soliloquy and the dramatic
monologue, which are formal speeches respecting conventional syntax. This “immediate
speech” is freed from introductory expressions like “He thought, he remembered,
he said”, from formal structures, and from logical and chronological order. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
