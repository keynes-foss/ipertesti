Woolf) starred in two of 2001’s box-office smashes, “The Others” and “Moulin
Rouge,” and received an Oscar‚ nomination and a London Film Critics Circle
“Best Actress” Award for her performance in the latter, as well as dual Golden
Globe nominations for both films. “The Other” also earned her a BAFTA
nomination. Following “The Hours,” Kidman starred in Lars Von Trier’s
“Dogville” and Robert Benton’s “The Human Stain.” She is currently filming
Anthony Minghella’s “Cold Mountain.” Born in Honolulu, Kidman was raised in
Sydney, Australia, where both her parents were born. She began acting during
her teens and made her cinematic debut in an Australian film, “Bush Christmas,”
at fourteen. She then began to mix her schoolwork with her acting, appearing in
projects such as “Winners” and the miniseries “Five-Mile Creek.” Between films,
Kidman studied at the Australian Theater for Young People in Sydney and the
Philip Street Theater. The much-lauded 1985 Kennedy-Miller miniseries
“Vietnam,” made her a virtual overnight star in Australia. Only 17 at the time,
she was voted Best Actress of the Year by the Australian public and the
Australian Film Institute. In addition to public and critical acclaim, her
performance in the series also attracted the attention of filmmakers throughout
Australia. Kidman’s other notable Australian films since then include “Emerald
City” (for which she received a Best Supporting Actress nomination from the
Australian Film Institute), “Flirting” and the miniseries “Bangkok Hilton.” For
the latter, Kidman once again received rave reviews, and was voted Best Actress
of 1989 by the Variety Awards and the Australian public. She also appeared on
stage playing lead roles in “Steel Magnolias” at the Sydney Seymour Center, for
which she was nominated Best Newcomer by the Sydney Theater Critics and “Spring
Awakening” at the Australian Theater for Young People. Kidman first came to the
attention of international audiences with her critically acclaimed performance
in the 1989 thriller “Dead Calm,” directed by Philip Noyce. Since then, she has
become one of the most sought-after actresses in film. Her 1995 appearance in
Gus Van Sant’s “To Die For” brought her a Golden Globe as well as Best Actress
Awards from the Boston Film Critics, the National Broadcast Film Critics,
London Film Critics and the Seattle Film Festival. She also received a BAFTA
nomination. Kidman made her highly-lauded London stage debut in the fall of
1998, starring with Iain Glen in “The Blue Room,” David Hare’s modern
adaptation of Schnitzler’s “La Ronde,” for director Sam Mendes and the Donmar
Warehouse. The production in which Kidman and Glen each took on five different
roles, was the hit of the London theater season, and for her performance,
Kidman won London’s <i>Evening</i><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span><i>Standard
</i>Award “for special and significant contribution to the London Theater.” She
was also nominated in the Best Actress category for a Laurence Olivier Award.
“The Blue Room” moved to Broadway for a smash limited run from November of 1998
through March of 1999. In 1999, Kidman starred in Stanley Ku b r i c k ’s last
film, “Eyes Wide Shut.” In 1998, she appeared in Griffin Dunne’s romantic
comedy “Practical Magic” and in 1997, Mimi L e d e r’s international thriller
“The Pe a c e m a ke r.” The year before, Kidman starred in Jane Campion’s
screen adaptation of Henry James’ “Po r t rait of a Lady.” Her other films
include “Billy Bathgate,” for which she received a Golden Globe nomination, “ M
a l i c e ,” “My Life” “Far and Away,” “Batman Fo r e ve r” and “Birthday Girl.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:14.0pt;color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>In the
hours, Nicole Kidman takes on the role of Virginia Woolf, the groundbreaking
feminist writer whose emotionally searing novels and taboo-defying life
continue to influence the view of women’s daily lives some 75 years later. It
is Woolf’s novel <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mrs. Dalloway</i> – and
those rare, precious moments Woolf writes about when life reveals its full
potential – that ties the elements of THE HOURS together. The film follows
Woolf on a singular June day during th writing of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Mrs. Dalloway</i>, a da that reveals the poignant truth of a line from
the book: “it was very, very dangerous to live even a single day.”Kidman had an
immediate, vesceral reaction to David Hare’s script for the Hours. “He’d
written the most extraordinary female character,” she said, “ each of whom
resonated for me. But Virginia Woolf seemed to come to me at a time when I
really needed her – the role was cathartic for me in a wonderful way. She gave
me a gift, in a certain sense, because I was very much needed to play her.” Kidman
delved into intensive researh, reading biographies, Wool’s letters and
everything she could find about the Bloomsbury Group, which provided the
creative hot-house setting in which Woolf blossomed. What she discovered was a
woman of many layers, a creative whirlwind of tremendous force who nevertheless
danced on the edge of madness as the price for her literary sensitivity. “Part
of playing someone who really existed is finding her essence,” says Kidman.
“David Hare gave me a lot of insight into her, and of course, Micheal Cunningham
did as well. Through this period I just fell in love with her. She was a woman
who grappled with death and madness and love. The profundity with which she
managed to capture the pathos of life has always been incredibly interesting
for me. Yet there was also a mischievousness to her, a playfulness and joie de
vivre that made people want to be in her orbit. People were so attracted to
her.” Kidman was particularly drawn to the relationship between Woolf and her
husband Leonard. “I was fascinated by her love for Leonard<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and his love for her and what they gave to
one another,” she comments. “I think she felt tremendous gratitude to her
husband for being so tolerant of her. So much of what she was fighting for was
just being able to breathe; being able to live in London if she wanted to live
in London, and not be trapped, as she saw it, out in Richmond. I think that
your creativity sterns from our environment a lot of the time. That reall
resonated with me.” Despite Kidman’s deep affinity for Virginia Woolf’s inner
world there was no denying that she would have to make physical transformation
to take on the role. “I was looking for was to capture the essence of
Virginia,” she says. “I experimented with changing my face, the way I walk, the
way I talk, all of those things. Physically and emotionally it came together at
the same time for me. It was all about finding her aura. For example. I learned
that she liked to roll her own cigarettes and that immediately gave me a
mannerism that is distinctly Virginia Woolf. So every time I wanted to do her
voice, I would just get out a cigarette, and m voice would drop an octave and
off I would go.” Kidman even studied Woolf’s handwriting, switching from her
own left-handed style to writing with her roght hand to embody Woolf more
closely. Helping Kidman complete the transformation were Ann Roth’s
custom-designed costumes based on Woolf’s notably aristocratic manner of
dressing. “There was something about those clothes- the shoes, the fabric of
the dress, even a little handkerchief that I used- as soon as I put that outfit
on, it was like I was able to move in a different way,” she says. But for
Kidman, the biggest inspiration of all was the writing contained both in
M.Cunningham’s novel and in David Hare’s screenplay. “As an example , I was
utterly moved my the scene on the train where Virginia talks about the choices
in life, and about knowing what ou want, and getting the chance to make the
decisions about what’s best for you,” she says. “I thought that scene was just
so beautifully realized in all its complexity and beauty. I just felt: how
magnificent as an actor to get the chance to say these words, and to put across
these ideas.” <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

another set of hours Laura has to get through. What she doesn’t expect is to
have a cataclysmic event in it. It shouldn’t be a day that leads to any other,
but it is actually her penultimate day in this particular life.” It was Moore’s
very personal and strong reaction to David Hare’s screenplay that compelled her
to take on the role of Laura Brown. “What David Hare managed to do,” she says,
“was to translate both the emotional reality and the structural reality of the
novel. I honestly didn’t think it could be done, but he did it beautifully.”
Moore had long been a fan of Michael Cunningham’s novel. She notes: “I’m a big
reader of fiction, and I’m rarely surprised by it. When you read a lot of
literature, you learn to look for clues, and you see what’s coming. But as a
book, “The Hours” completely stunned me. I was really surprised by it, and so
thrilled. When someone manages to do that, you feel like you’re twelve again.
Michael is able to be so incredibly truthful about the things that are painful
and difficult in the human condition, yet he’s tremendously hopeful and
inspiring, too. His concept of getting through ‘the hours’ of our day and of
our lives, and what that means reflects what is both painful and valuable about
life, all at once. I was so moved by it.” Moore sees her character as having
much in common with Virginia Woolf, whose spirit inspires the entire tapestry
of THE HOURS, and yet also views Laura as having her own unique tale to tell.
“What Laura shares with Virginia Woolf is her depression,” she notes. “But
whereas Virginia Woolf is aware of it as an illness, something she struggles
with, I think Laura is almost underwater. She’s not a person who’s even present
in her life. Her deep unhappiness is the state of her being. If Laura defines
herself in any way, she’s a passionate reader. That’s something that I used for
myself: the underlying idea that she shares a sense of literary-ness with
Virginia Woolf.” One of the most moving aspects of Laura’s story for Moore is
her complicated relationship with her son, one that had an affecting resonance
for the actress because she herself has two young children. “When I made the
movie, my son was three and a half, and during the shoot I was pregnant with my
daughter, so I understand what the connection is between a child and his
mother. The fact that this boy <i>was</i> so connected to his mother, and could
feel her depression, and was so lost – this was absolutely heartbreaking to me.
I’m not certain I would have understood this had I not been a mother myself.
But what’s agonizing is that you realize Laura makes the only choice she can at
the end of her story. In effect, she’s choosing to live rather than die. This
is a woman who is confused by issues in a marriage shedoesn’t want to be in;
she doesn’t have any idea about her sexuality; she’s desperately unhappy; she
doesn’t even know whether she wants to be in this life – she’s a reader, not a
participator. And she’s just lost. She has no options. Nothing. Today, it’s a
different world, and you <i>see </i>a different world in Clarissa’s life.
Here’s a woman who had a child because she wanted a child; is with the lover
she wants to be with; has made choices about her life. Laura has made almost no
choices; she’s retreated into books.” Ultimately, Moore began to look at her
character not just as a single individual but as part of the pantheon of
women’s lives. “The beauty of the story and the script is that these women’s
lives echo one another in such interesting ways, that same way that all of us,
in each of our lives, echo one another,” Moore observes. “This goes back to the
novel, which depicts such universality in the human condition. There is a sense
that as much as one person like Laura might suffer, might think she’s alone,
these<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>are feelings that are repeated
year after year, century after century, in a great chain. What was exciting for
me as an actress, was getting to play a certain moment, and seeing that echoed,
backward and forwards, in Meryl’s and Nicole’s stories.”<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

two-time Academy Award® winner and a recipient of twelve Oscar® nominations,
recently completed filming “Adaptation” starring opposite Nicolas Cage. Spike
Jonze directed this much-anticipated follow up to “Being John Malkovich.” Born
and raised in New Jersey, Streep began acting at Vassar, where she won the
title role in the first college production for which she auditioned. An honors
exchange program also allowed her to study in the drama department at
Dartmouth. After graduating from Vassar, she attended the renowned Yale Drama
School. She appeared in six of the seven plays presented annually by the Yale
Repertory Company, earning a Masters of Fine Arts degree in 1975. After a
summer with the O’Neill Playwrights Conference in Connecticut, Streep moved to
New York City and landed the ingenue lead in Joseph Papp’s Lincoln Center
production of “Trelawney of the Wells,” delivering a powerful performance that
stunned the critics. Before long, she received an Outer Critics’ Circle Award,
a Theater World Award and a Tony nomination for playing two different
characters in a Phoenix Theater double bill of Arthur Miller’s “A Memory of Two
Mondays” and Tennessee Williams’ “27 Wagons Full of Cotton.” Streep performed
in no less than seven plays during her first season in New York, including the
New York Shakespeare Festival productions of “Henry V” as Catherine and
“Measure for Measure” as Isabella. She then starred on Broadway in Kurt Weill’s
“Happy End” and won an Obie for her performance in the off-Broadway production
“Alice at the Palace.” During this period, Streep also won an Emmy for her
portrayal of a devastated German wife in the miniseries “Holocaust,” and made
her feature film debut as Jane Fonda’s snooty society friend in Fred Zinneman’s
“Julia.” In her second screen role, Streep appeared opposite Robert De Niro in
Michael Cimino’s “The Deer Hunter,” receiving her first Oscar‚ nomination for
her portrayal of a working-class Pennsylvania girl whose lonely, small town
life is irrevocably altered by the Vietnam war. Streep returned to the stage to
play Katherine in “The Taming of the Shrew” opposite Raul Julia for Joseph
Papp’s Public Theater. After appearing in Woody Allen’s “Manhattan” and Jerry
Schatzberg’s “The Seduction of Joe Tynan,” Streep rounded out the year as
Dustin Hoffman’s troubled former wife in Robert Benton’s acclaimed “Kramer vs.
Kramer,” for which she won an Academy Award‚ as Best Supporting Actress. Since
that time, Streep has worked with most of the film industry’s top directors,
including Karel Reisz (“The French Lieutenant’s Woman”), Mike Nichols
(“Silkwood,” “Heartburn” and “Postcards from the Edge”), Alan J. Pakula
(“Sophie’s Choice”), Fred Schepisi (“A Cry in the Dark” and “Plenty”), Robert
Zemeckis (“Death Becomes Her”), Curtis Hanson (“The River Wild”), Hector
Babenco (“Ironweed”), Sydney Pollack (“Out of Africa”), Albert Brooks
(“Defending Your Life”) and Bille August (“The House of the Spirits”). In
recent years, Streep has played such diverse characters as the tough mother of
a tougher adolescent (“Marvin’s Room”), a woman whose fatal illness draws her
closer to her adult daughter (“One True Thing”), an Italian immigrant in the
Midwest who strikes up a romance with an itinerant photographer (“The Bridges
of Madison County”), an Irish spinster in the 1930s (“Dancing at Lughnasa”),
and reallife Harlem high-school music teacher Roberta Guaspari (“Music of the
Heart”). In<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>1997, Streep was nominated
for an Emmy for “First, Do No Harm,” a television drama she co-produced and

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:14.0pt;color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>In THE
HOURS, the stories of Virginia Woolf in 1920s England, and Laura Brown in 1949
suburban Los Angeles, culminate in the contemporary urban tale of Clarissa
Vaughan in 1990s Greenwich Village, New York. Meryl Streep plays Clarissa, a
literary editor who is followed for one climactic day during which she plans a
party for her long-time friend and one-time lover, a prominent writer dying of
AIDS. In the midst of her preparations, Clarissa finds herself facing issues of
time, freedom, love and letting go of the past. Modeled in part on Virginia Woolf’s
character Clarissa Dalloway from the novel “Mrs. Dalloway”, this contemporary
Clarissa makes an impassioned examination of the choices she’s made in life.
Streep originally received Michael Cunningham’s novel as a gift. “I read the
book when it first came out because Natasha Richardson sent it to me as a
present and I thought it was beautiful,” she recalls. And yet this was one
novel Streep never imagined would become a motion picture. “When my agent
called me about the film, I couldn’t imagine how they were going to make it
into a movie, how so much of an interior world could be translated into a
film,” she explains. “But when the script came to me, I thought it was really
wonderful. David Hare has such a compassionate nature and he’s a consummate wordsmith.
He is able to express things that are inside people. He puts them in the
situation and makes it actable. I realized that this was going to be a very
unusual movie. There’s just nothing else like it out there in terms of how it
enters a world that is entirely undiscovered and un-traveled. It’s a
fascinating and deeply felt journey. And I think that was what convinced me it
would be an interesting project to work on.” The character of Clarissa is the
only one of the main heroines in THE HOURS who lives in our current times, in
an unconventional family structure, with a very contemporary lifestyle,
something that also interested Streep. “Clarissa has very complicated
relationships. She has her lover, Sally, but she’s also involved emotionally
with an old lover of hers, a man who is dying of AIDS, and to whom she still
feels strongly connected. I think she is like many women today who feel like
their life took a turn at some point and they don’t exactly understand how or
why. To me, that’s what the story is very much about: the expectations people
have in life, and the longing for life to live up to its fullest.” And unlike
Virginia Woolf and Laura Brown, Streep’s Clarissa lives in a time that
encourages greater freedom of expression and desire, especially for women. “My
character gets to be so much more emotional,” she observes. “The other two
women in the story are so contained, they’re suppressing so much, but I’m the
one who really explodes in the end.” Another aspect of THE HOURS that appealed
strongly to Streep was the chance to work with directory Stephen Daldry. “He
has a real understanding for how to physicalize the interior world. I mean, he
ran the Royal Court Theatre for years and he made “Billy Elliot” so he has this
very exuberant physicality. And this works for THE HOURS because what could
have been a very small, contained story has been completely opened up by him.”<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
