style='font-size:14.0pt;color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>It is not often
that a movie adapted from a book does credit to the original, but in the case
of Virginia Woolf's classic, <i>Mrs. Dalloway,</i> the adaptation does exactly
that. The movie can't really be called entertaining, but then neither can the
book. It is the story of the lives of several characters who seem to revolve
around the enigmatic Clarissa Dalloway. One very important aspect of the book
is the reverie, which is something like a daydream. This is a technique
Virginia Woolf uses to bring flashbacks and foreshadowing directly into the
character's stream of consciousness. Characters will do something that reminds
them of a past event, which they relive until some outside influence (such as a
noise) jars them back to the present. Since the reverie is so important in the
novel, it had to be incorporated into the movie. For example, the director had
the older Clarissa Dalloway fling open window shutters, and then the scene cuts
to the young Clarissa doing the same action. This was very effectively done,
with excellent direction throughout the movie. The acting was great, too.
Vanessa Redgrave perfectly creates the very beautiful, very remarkable,
slightly sentimental, aging Clarissa Dalloway. The character of Septimus Warren
Smith was especially well portrayed (by Rupert Graves) and exactly fit my image
of the character from the book. Without good acting in this role, the movie
would have lost much of its meaning, because the audience must grow to care about
him to enhance the emotional value of later events. This also applies to the
characters of Peter Walsh and Sally Seton. One must fully realize their glory
and individuality to regret their regression. All this was successfully
accomplished because of truly talented acting. The book itself is very refined,
and so is the movie; they both maintain a surrealism that becomes fascinating.<br>
Although &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; is definitely a refined and well-made movie
with great directing and acting, I would not recommend it to most viewers. Because
of its surrealism (vital if the book is to be depicted correctly), the movie
may seem a bit slow paced, philosophical and contemplative. The movie does
exactly what it should do: give credit to the original book.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:14.0pt;color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>, won
the Best Foreign Film Oscar. Now, two years later, Gorris' follow-up to that
much-lauded effort has arrived in the form of <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>, an
adaptation of Virginia Woolf's classic novel. Because of its strong leading
character and female-oriented themes, it's easy to understand why the film held
such appeal for an avowed feminist like Gorris. In conjunction with Vanessa
Redgrave, the director paints a probing-but-flawed portrait of a thoughtful
woman. Redgrave, who brings depth and a sense of poignant longing to Clarissa
Dalloway, was instrumental in getting this picture made. After canvassing
Virginia Woolf's body of work in preparation for a stage role, Redgrave was
struck by the potential cinematic quality of <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>, and suggested
to screenwriter Eileen Atkins that it would make a good movie. Several years
later, the film has traversed the road from concept to feature, and, six months
after making its debut at the 1997 Toronto Film Festival, it is opening in
selected theaters across North America. <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> is a &quot;day in
the life&quot; motion picture that uses flashbacks to broaden the time span
from a single day in June 1923 to a lifetime. The film begins by introducing
viewers to Clarissa Dalloway, the upper class wife of Richard Dalloway (John
Standing), a wealthy Member of Parliament. Clarissa, who lives a life that is
safe, isolated, and dull, is planning a gala party for the evening, where
guests of stature will mix and mingle, telling boring stories and engaging in
stuffy conversation. Clarissa is well-known for her parties, and they have
become social events in London society. Then something happens to shatter the
stillness of Mrs. Dalloway's life -- a man named Peter Walsh (Michael Kitchen),
an old flame from 30 years ago, shows up on her doorstep. This leads Clarissa
to think back to the choices she made during the summer of 1890, and how they
shaped the rest of her life. <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> is about regrets and coping
with the consequences of one's decisions. Clarissa has not led a bad life -- in
fact, it has been quite comfortable -- but she is cognizant that she gave up
love and passion for security. The point of the film isn't to debate whether
she made the right or wrong decision, but to emphasize that everyone has roads
not taken. For Clarissa, the alternative to her pampered life of parties and
domestic tranquillity would have been an existence of travel and adventure, two
things that frightened her. The greatest strength of <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> is
that it manages to effectively capture the poignancy and wistful yearning of
gazing back through the years at what was and what might have been. Clarissa's
bittersweet reminiscences are so powerfully-presented that they will strike a
responsive with many viewers. I left the film contemplating the undeniable
truth of how quickly (and sometimes cruelly) time passes everyone by. Juxtaposed
with Mrs. Dalloway's story is that of a young, shell-shocked soldier, Septimus
Warren- Smith (Rupert Graves), who has never recovered from his experiences in
World War I. This material, although thematically relevant to the main plot,
causes unwanted interruptions in the narrative that threaten to derail the
picture. Graves plays the part effectively, and the story of the young man's
loss of identity is tragic, but I found the Warren-Smith scenes to be more of a
distraction than a crucial subplot. Not surprisingly, the acting is top-notch. Redgrave
shines, whether she's gazing back through the mists of the past or, in the
film's best sequence, making pithy asides to expose the true nature of the
guests at her party. Michael Kitchen and John Standing are solid as the two men
who were once rivals for Clarissa's affections, and who have changed very
little over time. In flashbacks, Natascha McElhone (</span><span

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:14.0pt;color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>)
brings a sparkle to the young Clarissa, and Alan Cox cuts a dashing figure as
Peter. The 1890 scenes also feature Lena Headley as Clarissa's best friend, and
there are hints of a subtle lesbian attraction. <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> will
probably appeal most strongly to those who appreciate Merchant- Ivory's
unhurried pace. The story, which is more of a character study than a
plot-oriented narrative, moves slowly and deliberately, giving us a
crystal-clear picture of the many faces of Clarissa Dalloway -- who she was,
who she might have been, and who she has become. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> is a much-admired novel by Virginia Woolf, adapted to
the screen by Marleen Gorris (creator of the Oscar-winning Dutch film <i>Antonia's
Line</i>), and actress-turned-screenwriter Eileen Atkins. The redoubtable
Vanessa Redgrave brings the complex title character to life. Though I've never
read Woolf's novel, the film adaptation suggests strong comparisons to <i>The
Dead</i>, another sublime and subtle day-in-the-life story by Woolf's
contemporary, James Joyce, and to John Huston's fabulous 1987 film adaptation. In
both works, not much happens on the surface, but torrents rage below. Likewise,
a former love is central to both stories. In <i>The Dead</i>, he's long
deceased. In <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>, he's at her party. But unrequited love is
only one aspect of the past that has come back to nudge Mrs. Dalloway. As the
day goes on, she finds herself challenged by a whole raft of life's decisions. On
another level, Mrs. Dalloway represents an England trying to organize itself in
the years following the Great War. In contrast to Mrs. Dalloway is the film's
other major player, Septimus Warren Smith (Rupert Graves), a shell-shocked war
veteran who still is recoiling from the trench warfare that killed so many of
his comrades. Mrs. Dalloway talks frequently about &quot;taking the
plunge&quot; into the challenges of life. Smith, tragically, takes his plunge
into the dark abyss. <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> is a thought-provoking film for
literate viewers, featuring one of Vanessa Redgrave's most quietly intricate
performances. Several flashback scenes are distracting, though, because
Natascha McElhone, as the young Mrs. Dalloway, doesn't look much like the
distinctive Redgrave. But director Gorris showcases Redgrave and her co-stars
with elaborate period detail and artful camera work and scene staging. Another
challenging film once asked the question <i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</i>
If you've been among those who are, this challenging but accessible film might
help ease your phobia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
