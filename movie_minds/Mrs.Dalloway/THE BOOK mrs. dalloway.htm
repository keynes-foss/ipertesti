text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>In
Jacob's Room, the novel preceding Mrs. Dalloway, Virginia Woolf works with many
of the same themes she later expands upon in Mrs. Dalloway. To Mrs. Dalloway,
she added the theme of insanity. As Woolf stated, &quot;I adumbrate here a
study of insanity and suicide; the world seen by the sane and the insane side
by side.&quot; However, even the theme that would lead Woolf to create a double
for Clarissa Dalloway can be viewed as a progression of other similar ideas
cultivated in Jacob's Room. Woolf's next novel, then, was a natural development
from Jacob's Room, as well as an expansion of the short stories she wrote
before deciding to make Mrs. Dalloway into a full novel. The Dalloways had been
introduced in the novel, The Voyage Out, but Woolf presented the couple in a
harsher light than she did in later years. Richard is domineering and pompous.
Clarissa is dependent and superficial. Some of these qualities remain in the
characters of Mrs. Dalloway but the two generally appear much more reasonable
and likeable. Clarissa was modeled after a friend of Woolf's named Kitty Maxse,
whom Woolf thought to be a superficial socialite. Though she wanted to comment
upon the displeasing social system, Woolf found it difficult at times to respond
to a character like Clarissa. She discovered a greater amount of depth to the
character of Clarissa Dalloway in a series of short stories, the first of which
was titled, &quot;Mrs. Dalloway in Bond Street,&quot; published in 1923. The
story would serve as an experimental first chapter to Mrs. Dalloway. A great
number of similar short stories followed and soon the novel became inevitable.
As critic Hermione Lee details, &quot;On 14 October 1922 [Woolf] recorded that
ŒMrs. Dalloway has branched into a book,' but it was sometime before [Woolf]
could find the necessary balance between Œdesign and substance.'&quot; Within
the next couple years, Woolf became inspired by a Œtunneling' writing process,
allowing her to dig Œcaves' behind her characters and explore their souls. As Woolf
wrote to painter Jacques Raverat, it is &quot;precisely the task of the writer
to go beyond the Œformal railway line of sentence' and to show how people Œfeel
or think or dream...all over the place.'&quot; In order to give Clarissa more
substance, Woolf created Clarissa's memories. Woolf used characters from her
own past in addition to Kitty Maxse, such as Madge Symonds, on whom she based
Sally Seton. Woolf held a similar type of affectionate devotion for Madge at
the age of fifteen as a young Clarissa held for Sally. The theme of insanity
was close to Woolf's past and present. She originally planned to have Clarissa
die or commit suicide at the end of the novel but finally decided that she did
want this manner of closure for Clarissa. As critic Manly Johnson elaborates,
&quot;The original intention to have Clarissa kill herself ­ in the pattern of
Woolf's own intermittent despair ­ was rejected in favor of a Œdark double' who
would take that act upon himself. Creating Septimus Smith led directly to
Clarissa's mystical theory of vicarious death and shared existence, saving the
novel from a damaging balance on the side of darkness.&quot; Still, the
disassociation of crippling insanity from the character of Clarissa Dalloway
did not completely save Woolf from the pain of recollection. Woolf's husband
and close friends compared her periods of insanity to a manic depression quite
similar to the episodes experienced by Septimus. Woolf also included
frustratingly impersonal doctor types in Bradshaw and Holmes that reflected
doctors she had visited throughout the years. As the novel focused mainly on
the character of Clarissa Dalloway, Woolf changed the name of the novel to Mrs.
Dalloway from its more abstract working title, The Hours, before publishing it.
Woolf struggled to combine many elements that impinged on her sensibility as
she wrote the novel. The title, Mrs. Dalloway, best suited her attempts to join
them together. As Woolf commented, &quot;In this book I have almost too many
ideas. I want to give life and death, sanity and insanity; I want to criticize
the social system, and to show it at work, at its most intense.&quot;
Furthermore, she hoped to respond to the stagnant state of the novel, with a
consciously Œmodern' novel. Many critics believe she succeeded. The novel was
published in 1925, and received much acclaim. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>At
10 a.m. on a Wednesday early in June 1923, Clarissa Dalloway goes to Bond Street
to buy some flowers for a party she’s giving that evening at her house. While she
is in the flower shop, a car drives noisily past and shifts the attention to
the street, where Septimus and Lucrezia warren Smith are walking: he is an estate
agent’s clerk and shell-shocked veteran of the war, she is an Italian girl. Doctors
have been called in to deal with septimus’s mental problems. Clarissa walks
back to her house and there she receives an unexpectedvisit from Peter Walsh,
the man she once loved in her youth. He then leaves her house and goes to
Regent’s Park, where he meets Warren Smith, who is going to the doctor. His
visit lasts three-quarters of an hour and results in the arranging for Septimus
to go into a mental hospital. At six p.m. septimus commits suicide and his body
passes by Peter Walsh. All the characters who have been in some way important
during the day are present at Clarissa’s party. She hears about Septimus’s
death by the Bradshaws: clarissa feels a strong connection with the dead man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The
meaning of the novel does not lie in the events but in the reactions they
provoque in the characters. Clarissa does not simply walk up Bond Street, she
also perceives, thinks, remembers, her present and her past are linked and
mingled. Virginia Woolf wanted to show life as changing endlessly from moment
to moment. Not only are the characters emotionally aware of the moment as it
passes, but they also respond physically to the world around them. The characters
belong to the upper-middle class of doctors, lawyers, intellectuals, politicians.
In its time and place <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mrs.Dalloway</i> is
similar to James Joyce’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ulysses</i>: it
takes place on a single day, and it follows the portagonist through a very
small area of London, from the morning to the night of the day on which she
gives a large formal party. Woolf showed the deep humanity of her characters,
behind their social masks. They enjoy the sights of London, its parks, its
life, its flavour. The novel also provides a descrition of the new technologies
of that time (planes,cinema,newspapers,marital relationship...) She uses
cinematic devices (close-ups, flashbacks, tracking shots. The clocks act at the
same time as a structural connection and a symbol of time passing through life
into death. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

every place she has visited. She lacks a certain warmth, but is a caring woman
who is touched by the people around her and their connection to life in
general. Clarissa feels that her parties are her gift to the world and is proud
to share herself with others. She loves to be accepted but has the acuity of
mind to perceive her own flaws, especially since her recent illness. Clarissa
is a representative of an uppity English gentry class and yet, defies
categorization because of her humanity and her relation to her literary double,
Septimus Warren Smith. She is superficially based on Woolf's childhood friend,
Kitty Maxse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Evans, and becomes extremely sensitive to color and natural beauty. The doctors
compound his problems by ignoring them, and they become the embodiment of evil

alternate persona, the darker, more internal personality compared to Clarissa's
very social and singular outlook. Woolf's use of the doppelganger, Septimus,
portrays a side to Clarissa's personality that becomes absorbed by fear and
broken down by society and a side of society that has failed to survive the
War. The doubling portrays the polarity of the self and exposes the
positive-negative relationship inherent in humanity. It also illustrates the

style='color:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> Woolf creates a new novelistic
structure in Mrs. Dalloway wherein her prose has blurred the distinction

being functions in this manner, simultaneously flowing from the conscious to
the unconscious, from the fantastic to the real, and from memory to the moment.

artificiality of Clarissa's life and her involvement in it. The detail given
and thought provoked in one day of a woman's preparation for a party, a simple
social event, exposes the flimsy lifestyle of England's upper classes at the
time of the novel. Even though Clarissa is effected by Septimus' death and is
bombarded by profound thoughts throughout the novel, she is also a woman for
whom a party is her greatest offering to society. The thread of the Prime
Minister throughout, the near fulfilling of Peter's prophecy concerning
Clarissa's role, and the characters of the doctors, Hugh Whitbread, and Lady
Bruton as compared to the tragically mishandled plight of Septimus, throw a
critical light upon the social circle examined by Woolf. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

those who have been cut off from such connections and who suffer because of the
improper treatment they, henceforth, receive. The critic, Ruotolo, excellently
develops the idea behind the theme: &quot;Estranged from the sanity of others, rooted
to the pavement,' the veteran [Septimus] asks for what purpose' he is present.
Virginia Woolf's novel honors and extends his question. He perceives a beauty
in existence that his age has almost totally disregarded; his vision of new
life... is a source of joy as well as madness. Unfortunately, the glimpse of
beauty that makes Septimus less forlorn is anathema to an age that worships
like Septimus' inhuman doctor, Sir William Bradshaw, the twin goddesses
Proportion' and Conversion.'&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
