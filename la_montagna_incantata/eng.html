<h1>THE WASTE LAND </h1>

<h2>Biography of the author</h2>
<img src="eliot3.png"  height="150" border="0" alt="" align="left" />Thomas Stearns Eliot, or T.S. Eliot as he is better known, was born in 1888 in St. Louis. He was the son of a prominent industrialist who came from a well- connected Boston family. Eliot always felt the loss of his family's New England roots and seemed to be somewhat ashamed of his father's business success; throughout his life he continually sought to return to the epicenter of Anglo- Saxon culture, first by attending Harvard and then by emigrating to England, where he lived from 1914 until his death. Eliot began graduate study in philosophy at Harvard and completed his dissertation, although the outbreak of World War I prevented him from taking his examinations and receiving the degree. By that time, though, Eliot had already written "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock," and the War, which kept him in England, led him to decide to pursue poetry full-time.

<br /><br /><img src="eliot6.png" width="110" height="110" border="0" alt="" align="right" />Eliot met Ezra Pound in 1914, as well, and it was Pound who was his main mentor and editor and who got his poems published and noticed. During a 1921 break from his job as a bank clerk (to recover from a mental breakdown), Eliot finished the work that was to secure him fame, The Waste Land. This poem, heavily edited by Pound and perhaps also by Eliot's wife, Vivien, addressed the fragmentation and alienation characteristic of modern culture, making use of these fragments to create a new kind of poetry. It was also around this time that Eliot began to write criticism, partly in an effort to explain his own methods. In 1925, he went to work for the publishing house Faber & Faber. Despite the distraction of his wife's increasingly serious bouts of mental illness, Eliot was from this time until his death the preeminent literary figure in the English-speaking world; indeed, he was so monumental that younger poets often went out of their way to avoid his looming shadow, painstakingly avoiding all similarities of style.

His poetry from this point onward shows a greater religious bent, although it never becomes dogmatic the way his sometimes controversial cultural criticism does. Four Quartets, his last major poetic work, combines a Christian sensibility with a profound uncertainty resulting from the war's devastation of Europe. Eliot died in 1965 in London.

<h2>PARIS REVIEW INTERVIEW (1959)</h2>

 <i>INTERVIEWER</i>: Does the manuscript of the original, uncut
 Waste Land exist? 
<br /><br />
 <i>ELIOT</i>: Don't ask me. That's one of the things I don t know. It's an unsolved mystery. I sold it to John Quinn. I also gave him a notebook of unpublished poems, because he had been kind to me in                        various affairs. That's the last I heard of them. Then he died and they didn't turn up at the sale.
 <br /><br />
<i>INTERVIEWER</i>: What sort of thing did Pound cut from The Waste Land? Did he cut whole sections? 
<br /><br />
<i>ELIOT</i>: Whole sections, yes. There was a long section about a shipwreck. I don't know what that had to do with anything else, but it was rather inspired by the Ulysses Canto in The Inferno I think. Then there was another section which was an imitation Rape of the Lock. Pound said, 'It's no use trying to do something that somebody else has done as well as it can be done. Do something different.' 
<br /><br />
<i>INTERVIEWER</i>: Did the excisions change the intellectual structure of the poem?
<br /><br />
<i>ELIOT</i>: No, I think it was just as structureless, only in a more futile way, in the longer version.
<br /><br />
<i>INTERVIEWER</i>: I have a question about the poem which is related to its composition. In Thoughts after Lambeth you denied the allegation of critics who said that you expressed "the disillusionment of a generation" in The Waste Land, or you denied that it was your intention. Now F.R. Leavis, I believe, has said that the poem exhibits no progression; yet on the other hand, more recent critics, writing after your later poetry, found The Waste Land Christian. I wonder if this was part of your intention.
<br /><br />
<i>ELIOT</i>: No, it wasn't part of my conscious intention. I think that in Thoughts after Lambeth I was speaking of intentions more in a negative than in a positive sense, to say what was not my intention. I wonder what an "intention" means! One wants to get something off one's chest. One doesn't know quite what it is that one wants to get off the chest until one's got it off. But I couldn't apply the word "intention" positively to any of my poems. Or to any poem. 
<br /><br />



<h2>FROM THOUGHTS AFTER LAMBETH (1931)</h2>                                                                  

<img src="eliot.png" height="270" border="0" alt="" align="left"/>I dislike the word "generation". When I wrote a poem called The Waste Land some of the more approving critics said I had expressed "the disillusionment of a generation", which is non-sense. I may have expressed for them their own illusion of being disillusioned, but that did not form part of my intention.

After such knowledge, what forgiveness?
<br /><br />
Eliot's most complete expression of the theme of emotional starvation is to be found in that poem, the later and longer one, called The Waste Land (1922). In such a passage as the conclusion of The Burial of the Dead, Eliot reveals the way in which he himself possesses "a sense of his own age", that "peculiar honesty, which, in a world too frightened to be honest, is peculiarly terrifying. It is an honesty against which the whole world conspires because it is unpleasant." Eliot used those words in describing Blake and he also said: "Nothing have this quality: exhibiting the essential sickness or strength  of the human soul." The Waste Land of the poem is a symbol borrowed from the myth of the Holy Grail: it is a desolate and sterile country ruled by an impotent king, in which not only have the crops ceased to grow and the animals to reproduce, but the very human inhabitants who have become incapable of having children. But this sterility we soon identify as the sterility of the Puritan temperament. 
<br /><br />T. S. Eliot now lives in London and has become an English citizen; but the desolation, the aesthetic and spiritual drought, of Anglo-Saxon middle-class society oppresses London as well as Boston. The terrible dreariness of the great modern cities is the atmosphere in which The Waste Land takes place, amidst this dreariness, brief, vivid images emerge, brief pure moments of feeling are distilled; but all about us we are aware of nameless millions performing barren office routines, wearing down their souls in interminable labours of which the products never bring them profit, people whose pleasures are so sordid and so feeble that they seem almost sadder than their pains. And this Waste Land has another aspect: it is a place not merely of desolation, but of anarchy and doubt. In our post-War world of shattered institutions, strained nerves and bankrupt ideals, life no longer seems serious or coherent; we have no belief in the things we do and consequently we have no heart for them. 
<br /><br />         The poet of The Waste Land is living half the time in the real world of contemporary London and half the time in the haunted wilderness of the medieval legend. The water for which he longs in the twilight desert of his dream is to quench the spiritual thirst which torments him in the London dusk;  so the poet of The Waste Land, making water the symbol of all freedom, all fecundity and flowering of the soul, invokes in desperate need the memory of an April shower of his youth, the song of the hermit thrush with its sound of water dripping and the vision of a drowned Phoenician sailor, sunk beyond "the cry of gulls and the deep sea swell", who has at least died by water, not thirst. The poet, who seems now to be travelling in a country cracked by drought, can only feverishly dream of these things. One's head may be well stored with literature, but the heroic prelude of the Elizabethans has ironic echoes in modem London streets and modern London drawing-rooms: lines remembered from Shakespeare turn jazz or refer themselves to the sound of phonographs.  
<br /><br />  Eliot had, in his early poetry, introduced phrases from Shakespeare and Blake for purposes of ironic effect. He has always, furthermore, been addicted to prefacing his poems with quotations and echoing passages from other poets. But now, in The Waste Land, he carries this tendency to what one must suppose its extreme possible limit: here, in a poem of only four hundred and thirty-three lines (to which are added, however, seven pages of notes), he manages to include quotations from, allusions to, or imitations of, at least thirty-five different writers (some of them, such as Shakespeare and Dante, laid under contribution several times), as well as several popular songs; and to introduce passages in six foreign languages, including Sanskrit. And we must also take into consideration that the idea of the literary medley itself seems to have been borrowed from still another writer, Pound. We are always being dismayed, in our general reading, to discover that lines among those which we had believed to represent Eliot's residuum of original invention, had been taken over or adapted from other writers. One would be inclined a priori to assume that all this load of erudition and literature would be enough to sink any writer, and that such a production as The Waste Land must be a work of second-hand inspiration. And it is true that, in reading Eliot and Pound, we are sometimes visited by uneasy recollections. Yet Eliot manages to be most effective precisely where he might be expected to be least original; he succeeds in conveying his meaning, in communicating his emotion, in spite of all his learned or mysterious allusions, and whether we understand them or not. 
<br /><br />He is keenly aware of our contemporary historicalconsciousness, and of the problems which it creates. The modem educated man possesses a knowledge of the past to a degree hardly glimpsed a century ago, not only of one segment of the past, but, increasingly, of all pasts. If he is sensitive to what he knows, he can feel, in Eliot's words, 'that the whole of the literature of Europe from Homer... has a simultaneous existence'. But also, owing to the self-consciousness which results from so much knowledge (scientific and psychological as well as historical and literary), he will have a sense in any given moment, as Eliot has remarked of Joyce, "of everything happening at once".
<br /><br />  Such a realization can lead either to chaos or to a sense of the potential unity of life. The difficulty with our knowledge to-day consists in the fact that instead of giving the individual's mind release and freedom, the piling up of so many disparate and seemingly unrelated details can merely oppress him with their bewildering variety, with "being too conscious and conscious of too much", with the futility of any certainty, or, as Eliot has reflected, with the feeling that 'everybody is conscious of every question, and no one knows any answers. The problem for the artist is to discover some unified pattern in this variety; and yet, if he believes as Eliot does that poetry should embody a man's reaction to his whole experience, also to present the full sense of its complexity. He can accomplish this double task of accurately recording what he has felt and perceived, and at the same time interpreting it, only if he grasps the similarity that often lies beneath contrasting appearances, and can thus emphasize the essential equivalence of seemingly different experiences. Such understanding and resultant emphasis constitute Eliot's chief reason for introducing so many reminiscences of other poets into the texture of his own verse. In this way he can at once suggest the extensive consciousness of the past that is inevitably possessed by any cultivated reader of to-day, and, more importantly, can greatly increase the implications of his lines by this tacit revelation of the sameness (as well as the contrasts) between the life of the present and that of other ages.
<br /><br />Use of such widely divergent details in a single poem indicates the special problem of the contemporary artist. Faced with so great a range of knowledge as a part of the modern consciousness, he can bring it to satisfactory expression in one of two ways. either by expansion or compression. It can hardly be coincidence that each of these ways was carried to its full development at almost the same time, in the years directly following the War. Joyce chose the first alternative for Ulysses and devoted more than a quarter of a million words to revealing the complexity involved in the passage of a single ordinary day. In the following year Eliot concentrated an interpretation of a whole condition of society into slightly over four hundred lines. That Eliot was aware of similarities in their aims is indicated in a brief essay which he published during the year after the appearance of The Waste Land on "Ulysses, Order, and Myth". how important it had been for Joyce to find a scaffold for his work in the structure of the Odyssey.
<br /><br />The utilization of such a discovery would clearly differ for the novelist and the poet. With the example of the nineteenth century behind him, Eliot naturally felt that, if the long poem was to continue to exist, there must be more to distinguish it than length, that its energy must be increased by the elimination of everything superfluous. To convey in poetry the feeling of the actual passage of life, to bring to expression the varied range and volume of awareness which exists in a moment of consciousness, demanded, in Eliot's view, the strictest condensation.
<br /><br />If, in severest analysis, the kind of poetry Eliot writes gives evidence of social disintegration, he has expressed that fact as the poet should, not by rhetorical proclamation, but by the very feeling of contemporary life which he has presented to the sensitive reader of his lines. And he has presented this not merely as something which the reader is to know through his mind, but is to know primarily as an actual physical experience, as a part of his whole being, through the humming pulsating evidence of his senses: there should not be a separation in an individual's sensibility between reading and experience any more than between emotion and thought.
