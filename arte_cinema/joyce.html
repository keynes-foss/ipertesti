</H1>
<P>
Among the authors who have accomplished the traditional novel's modification,
we must remember <A HREF="jamesj.html"><B><I>James Joyce</I></B></A>, above
all, with his most famous book
<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><B><I>"Ulysses"</I></B></FONT>, which has formally
the structure of &nbsp;"Odyssey". As a matter of fact, the work is divided
into eighteen chapters, which refer to Homer's scheme: every chapter has
a reference to the hour of the day (the whole action develops in a day),
to the technique used, to a science or an art, to a part of the body. &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The three main characters:
<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><B><I>Stephen
Dedalus</I></B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff80ff"><B> </B></FONT>(the young rebellious
artist), <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><B><I>Leopold Bloom</I></B></FONT> (the old
dubliner jewish, curious of experiences) and
<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I><B>Molly
Bloom</B></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#8080ff"><I> </I></FONT>(the unfaithful
wife) correspond respectively to Telemacus, Ulysses and Penelope.
<P>
"Ulysses" talks about the events which happens to the protagonist Leopold
Blumm in a day of his life. He is a person who has not the courage of
&nbsp;coming back home because, there, a terrible wife is waiting for him:
she is beautiful and sensual, but she is openly unfaithful to him and he
has not with her a relationship in which his dignity is respected.&nbsp;It
is the story of a man who constantly postpone the moment of the objective
confrontation with his life, represented through the confrontation with his
wife. This dismay, this refusal of&nbsp; Leopold coincides with loosing himself
&nbsp;among &nbsp;Dublin's streets; during this wandering he meets Stephen,
who is in search of a father figure, which he eventually finds in Leopold.
<P>
The novel has not a linear course, but it is a simply digression of &nbsp;the
man in the city (in the world). The interesting aspect is the narrative method
of this book: through the itinerary of &nbsp;Leopold and Stephen, the reader
knows reality and the objects, described with a lot of precision. However
we realize that the ordinary things have, as Joyce says, an endless expansion
which he calls
<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><B><I>"rediens"</I></B></FONT>.&nbsp;Therefore the
relation of &nbsp;Leopold with the world is never totally defined and the
objects are considered&nbsp;for what they hide and not for what they are.
The world at last, in this novel, ie an
<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><B><I>"epiphany"</I></B></FONT>, it is a manifestation
of the hidden senses and of the secret meanings.
<P>
Therefore the novel does not express a conventional knowledge of the world,
but it wants to communicate what the world conceals and what is hidden in
the deepest and most secret aspects of &nbsp;human personality: its anguishes,
its fears and its need of life.
<P>
The narrator is conscious of &nbsp;these things and he tells with a language
which is no more conventional&nbsp;and narrative because the language helps
no more to describe facts but the repercussions that the reality has on the
author's conscience.&nbsp;The technique, which express this kind of
&nbsp;statements, is called <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><B><I>"interior
monologue"</I></B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff80ff"><B> </B></FONT>or
<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><B><I>"stream of
&nbsp;consciousness"</I></B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000a0">; </FONT>Joyce had
already used this technique in&nbsp;"Dubliners", where he had adopted a
pseudo-narrator at the third person who had the only task of signalizing
actions and refering the thoughts of the protagonist but, with "Ulysses",
we assist to the narrator's "destruction": only the protagonists' thoughts
remain on the page.
<P>
The writing of &nbsp;the novel has the same cadence of the interior monologue,
of the solitary reflection of man who is crossed by a
<FONT COLOR="#ff80ff"><B><I><A HREF="flussodc.html">flux of endless
thoughts</A> </I></B></FONT>and sensations and who instinctively converts
into language. This explains also the chaotic and apparently shapeless structure
of &nbsp;"Ulysses", after that the conventional narrative structure is skipped:
what interests is no more the relation of &nbsp;the fact and, therefore,
in the middle there is no more a hero who represents the meaning or the synthesis
of the narrated facts. In the middle of the novel there is, instead, the
conscience which is something unknown for the protagonist himself,&nbsp;which
only the language, with its endless flux, succeeds in discovering.
