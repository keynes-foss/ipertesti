    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">William Blake was born in 1757, the third son of a London hosier. Apart
    from a brief idyllic sojourn to Felpham, West Sussex, Blake lived in or near to London, a
    city which dominates much of his work, whether as the nightmare 'London' of the Songs of
    Experience, or the London which Blake saw as the 'New Jerusalem', the kingdom of God on
    earth. As the son of a hosier, a generally lower middle class occupation in late
    eighteenth century London, he was brought up in a poor household, a preparation for the
    relative poverty in which he would live for most of his life. He also received little
    formal schooling, which is all the more remarkable given both the depth and range of his
    reading of the Bible, of Milton and Greek and Latin classic literature, evident throughout
    his work. His intellectual and psychological growth, however, was dominated by the
    influence of his brother, Robert, who died of consumption at the age of 20. Blake,
    witnessing his brother's death, remarked that he saw his brother's soul &quot;ascend
    heavenward clapping its hands for joy&quot;, and continued, from that point on, to feel
    Robert's inspirational influence over his work. Blake, who had already testified to seeing
    visions - (at the age of ten he tried to convince his father that he had seen hosts of
    angels in a tree in Peckham Rye) - retained this strong faith in the spirit world
    throughout his life, affirming that he often spoke with the apparitions, angels, devils
    and spirits which populate his work. It was this psychical interest which also brought him
    into contact with that strange world of late eighteenth century London psychics,
    visionaries, and various other Christian and progressive free-thinking writers and
    intellectuals such as Emanuel Swedenborg. Blake's subsequent career as an artist was
    inaugurated by his apprenticeship, in 1771, to James Basire, a noted Engraver, after which
    he enrolled as a student at the Royal Academy (1797), an Academy then dominated by the
    influence of its Principal, Sir Joshua Reynolds. <img src="images/blake_vecchiaia.jpg" width="249" height="363" alt="blake vecchiaia.jpg (75286 byte)" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10">From 1779 he was employed as an engraver for a local Bookseller, and Blake
    continued to earn an often precarious living from contracted engraving until, with the
    help of his friend John Flaxman (1755-1826), he was able to set up his own engraving
    business at 27 Broad Street, which proved not to be a successful enterprise. <br>
    It is from this point, 1784, that Blake's career as an engraver-poet-prophet began in
    earnest. Working with the help of his dedicated wife Catherine Boucher (the daughter of a
    market gardener, whom he married in 1782), Blake divided his time between composing and
    engraving illustrated poetry, and eking out a precarious living as a contract engraver.
    His first works in illustrated painting - All Religions Are One and There is No Natural
    Religion (1788) - followed on from the satirical verse of An Island in the Moon (1784-5),
    but it was in 1789, the year of the French Revolution and the Storming of the Bastille,
    that saw Blake's early masterpieces, The Book of Thel and Songs of Innocence. Between 1789
    and 1800, when the Blake&#146;s moved to Felpham, Blake was ferociously active, composing
    The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (1790-93), The French Revolution (1791), America: A
    Prophecy (1793), Visions of the Daughters of Albion (1793), The Book of Urizen (1794), the
    <a href="#song"><strong>Songs of Experience</strong></a> (1793-4), Europe: A Prophecy
    (1794) The Book of Los (1795) and The Four Zoas (1795-1804). Uniting all of these was an
    extraordinary mixture of apocalyptic vision, political fervour, revisions of Christian
    theology and psychological exploration. Part of the reason for this extraordinary creative
    energy was that Blake felt compelled to work through his responses to the political
    upheavals of in Europe and America in this period. The American Revolution of 1775, and
    the Declaration of Independence in 1783 was, for Blake, just one example of youthful
    energetic rebellion against the forces of Autocratic Authority. Blake, who met Tom Paine
    in the early 1790s, sided with the American forces, mythologising them in his writings
    into the epic cosmic struggle between the forces of the Authoritarian Jehovah (the figure
    of &quot;Urizen&quot;) and the forces of youthful rebellion (symbolised by the
    mythological figure of Orc). The French Revolution of 1789 represented, for Blake, a
    similar irruption of necessary rebellion against the corruption of the 'Ancien Regime'
    and, once again, his sympathies were with the revolutionaries and supporters such as Paine
    (whom he helped save, in 1793, when Paine was in danger of being arrested, allowing him to
    escape to France). The British war with France, 1793, and the introduction of rigorous
    laws of civil obedience were, for Blake, yet further instances of the hold which the
    forces of Authority (Church and State) held over the common people: like Wordsworth, and
    Shelley and Byron a generation later, Blake was politically both a Radical and a
    libertarian. Yet, as Blake himself realized, the forces of youthful rebellion which had
    promised to usher in a new dawn in human consciousness swiftly gave way to the bloodshed
    and anarchy of the Reign of Terror and the imposition of new stricter forms of social
    control in both France and Britain. His works, from 1794 onwards, reflect a sense of the
    paradoxes and complexities of rebellion although, as his work also testifies, Blake
    remained unswervingly committed to the principles of equality in all forms (social,
    political and sexual), to liberty and to justice. <br>
    In 1800 Blake moved to West Sussex and spent nearly three idyllic years there, until the
    dramatic events which led to him being charged with sedition: in 1803 he was charged, at
    Chichester, with high treason (for being too vocal in his responses to a soldier he found
    urinating in his garden). That year Blake returned to London, where he lived until his
    death in 1827. Yet the final 24 years of his life saw Blake producing voluminous amounts
    of illustrated work and engraving, including the monumental work Milton (begun in Felpham
    but finished only in 1808) and Jerusalem, 1804-20), and illustrated versions of Dante and
    The Book of Job. These later years were, however, disappointing for Blake: he had not
    found the fame and recognition he longer for and, as for most of his life, he was never
    far from penury. What did not change also was Blake's passionate commitment to a vision of
    Christianity revisioned, and to a Spiritual, Psychological, Political and Sexual
    Renaissance, brought about by discarding the narrow moralising and conventionality of
    orthodox Christianity, and his vision of Albion reborn, in Everyman and in England. Blake
    died in 1827, and was buried in a common grave. </p>

    <h2 ALIGN="CENTER">The Tiger </h2>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER">Tiger, Tiger, burning bright<br>
    In the forests of the night,<br>
    What immortal hand or eye<br>
    Could frame thy fearful symmetry?<br>
    <br>
    In what distant deeps or skies<br>
    Burnt the fire of thine eyes?<br>
    On what wings dare he aspire?<br>
    What the hand dare seize the fire?<br>
    <br>
    And what shoulder and what art<br>
    Could twist the sinews of thy heart?<br>
    And when thy heart began to beat,<br>
    What dread hand? and what dread feet?<br>
    <br>
    What the hammer? what the chain?<br>
    In what furnace was thy brain?<br>
    <br>
    What the anvil? what dread grasp<br>
    Dare its deadly terrors clasp?<br>
    <br>
    When the stars threw down their spears,<br>
    And watered heaven with their tears,<br>
    Did he smile his work to see?<br>
    Did he who made the Lamb make thee?<br>
    <br>
    Tiger, Tiger, burning bright<br>
    In the forests of the night,<br>
    What immortal hand or eye<br>
    Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?</p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Blake's most famous poem raises profound questions, but does not
    finally answer them. How could the creator make something as terrifying and awesome as the
    Tiger? Could the same creator also be responsible for making the Lamb (both Christ, and
    the creator whose meek and mild spirit dominates the Songs of Innocence)? Is the Tiger not
    created in God's own image? Is the Tiger a symbol of Evil, for elsewhere (as in The
    Marriage of Heaven and Hell) Blake praises energy as a form of good and delight. These
    speculations lead to wider questions, about the wisdom of a God who can create such
    terrifyingly destructive creations, and questions of God's creation of Good and Evil, or
    Good-and-Evil. Comparison with <strong>The Lamb</strong> in the Songs of Innocence is
    extremely illuminating here. The Tiger is personified as having been born from fire
    (stolen from the Gods by Prometheus?), forged rather than created, and characterised also
    in terms of its (metallic) coldness: note the effectiveness of the poem's imagery in
    creating associations of fire, coldness and darkness. Interpretation of the poem is
    complicated by the fact that we cannot assume the speaker of the poem to be Blake himself,
    but perhaps any poet, who has created this Tiger out of his own imagination (&quot;forests
    of the night&quot;).</p>
    <hr noshade size="1">

    <h2 ALIGN="CENTER">The Sick Rose </h2>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER">Rose, thou art sick!<br>
    The invisible worm<br>
    That flies in the night,<br>
    In the howling storm,<br>
    <br>
    Has found out thy bed<br>
    Of crimson joy;<br>
    And his dark secret love<br>
    Does thy life destroy.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many have seen this poem as directly sexual, in its references to
    venereal disease and to the corruption of the innocent Rose by the masculine
    &quot;invisible worm&quot; of sexual experience. Certainly the poem draws on these, but it
    should also be read less literally, relying on the traditional associations of the Rose
    (Love, the young girl) in its depiction of an altered state of psychological (and
    spiritual) awareness. The sickness, however, may well be an internal psychological
    sickness that comes from unacted desires within the Rose (&quot;Sooner murder an infant in
    its cradle than nurse unacted desires&quot;, from the 'Proverbs of Hell' in The Marriage
    of Heaven and Hell) rather than corruption forced from outside. This is a recurrent theme
    in the Songs of Experience</p>
    <hr noshade size="1">
    <h2 ALIGN="CENTER">The Chimney Sweeper (Experience) </h2>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER">A little black thing among the snow,<br>
    Crying 'weep! 'weep! in notes of woe!<br>
    &quot;Where are thy father and mother, say?&quot;<br>
    &quot;They are both gone up to the church to pray.<br>
    <br>
    Because I was happy upon the heath,<br>
    And smiled among the winter's snow,<br>
    They clothed me in the clothes of death,<br>
    And taught me to sing the notes of woe.<br>
    <br>
    And because I am happy and dance and sing,<br>
    They think they have done me no injury,<br>
    And are gone to praise God and his Priest and King,<br>
    <br>
    Who make up a heaven of our misery.&quot;<br>
    </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A very much darker and more savage vision here than in the counterpart
    poem in the Songs of Innocence. The references to a church which is complicit in the
    repression of the child, together with the treatment of the negligent parents, make this
    one of the most bitter poems in the sequence, with its emphasis on a whole system (God,
    Priest and King) which represses the child, even forcing him to conceal his unhappiness (a
    reference to being &quot;clothed&quot;), psychologically as well as physically).</p>
    <hr noshade size="1">
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><big><big><strong>The Fly</strong></big></big></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER">Little Fly,<br>
    Thy summer's play<br>
    My thoughtless hand<br>
    Has brushed away.<br>
    <br>
    Am not I<br>
    A fly like thee?<br>
    Or art not thou<br>
    A man like me?<br>
    <br>
    For I dance<br>
    And drink and sing,<br>
    Till some blind hand<br>
    Shall brush my wing.<br>
    <br>
    If thought is life<br>
    And strength and breath,<br>
    And the want<br>
    Of thought is death,<br>
    <br>
    Then am I<br>
    A happy fly,<br>
    If I live<br>
    Or if I die.</p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The speaker, in this poem, speculates on whether he is or is not like the Fly,
    carelessly swept away by the speaker's hand. The Fly may have little, if any, conscious
    awareness of himself and his mortality and, if the speaker shares that freedom from
    awareness, then life or death is of little consequence. If, on the other hand, the fly
    does have human awareness then it is a different story.</p>
