William Blake was an English
poet, <a href="dante.html">painter and printmaker</a>. Largely
unrecognised during his
lifetime, but today Blake's work is considered too significant in
the history of both poetry and the visual arts.<br>
      <br>
He was born in London on 28 November 1757, from a middle-class family.
He never attended school, being educated at home by his mother. The
Blake belonged to the Moravian Church (is a mainline Protestant
denomination). The Bible was an early and profound influence on Blake,
and would remain a source of inspiration throughout his life.<br>
      <br>
Blake is
highly regarded today for his expressiveness and creativity, Blake said
that: "The imagination is not a State: it is the Human existence
itself".<br>
His visual art and written poetry are usually considered
separately, but he used both for example he was a printmaker of his
poems (see <a href="songs.html">Songs of Innocence and Experience</a>
and <a href="The%20marriage%20of%20heaven%20and%20hell.html">The
Marriage of Heaven and Hell</a>)<br>
He was a freethinker, for exemple he supported the French Revolution
and he remained a radical for all his life.<br>
      <p>Till Joung William Blake said to have visions. The first time
was when he was 8-10 years old, when he lived in London. He saw that
there was some angles "bespangling every bough like stars" on a tree.
According to a Blake's biographer, he returned home to report that, but
he only escaped to being hit by his father through the intervention of
his mother.<br>
Blake claimed to experience visions for all his life.<span

      <big style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Something on his Death</big><br>
On the day of his death, Blake worked hardly on his watercolors. It's
reported that he stopped working and turned to his wife, who was crying
by his bedside. Beholding her, Blake said: "Stay Kate! Keep just as you
are - I will draw your portrait - for you have ever been an angel to
me."<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>
      </span>
      <p>He was buried five days after his death, on the eve of his
forty-fifth wedding anniversary. Present at the ceremonies were
Catherine, Edward Calvert, George Richmond, Frederick Tatham and John
Linnell. Catherine moved into Tatham's house as a housekeeper. She
continued selling his illuminated works and paintings.<sup
 class="reference" id="_ref-20"><a title="" href="#_note-20"></a></sup></p>
      <p>On her death, Blake's manuscripts were taken by Tatham (a
follower Blake's artist), who burned several of those which he
considered heretical.</p>
      <big><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Blake and religion</span></big><br>
His view of religion is evident in <a
 href="The%20marriage%20of%20heaven%20and%20hell.html">The
Marriage of Heaven and Hell</a>, a series of texts written in
imitation of biblical prophecy. <big style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

Some Blake's Quotations</big>:<br>
      <span style="font-size: 125%;"><b> &laquo;</b></span>&nbsp;<span

imagination is not a State: it is the Human existence itself.&nbsp;</span><span

 style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;Men are admitted into Heaven not
because they have curbed &amp; govern'd their Passions or have No
Passions, but because they have Cultivated their Understandings. The
Treasures of Heaven are not Negations of Passion, but Realities of
Intellect, from which all the Passions Emanate Uncurbed in their
Eternal Glory.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 125%;"><b><span
