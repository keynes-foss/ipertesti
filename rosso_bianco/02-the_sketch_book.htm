              wrote it while he was in England, and it was published simultaneously 
              in England and America. Since the work was written in the backdrop 
              of war of 1812, the political acrimony between American and English 
              publics at that time cannot be ruled out as a factor affecting their 
              feelings towards each other. </font></span><font size="1" face="Verdana" color="#990033"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: IT; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">The 
              war in fact, “initiated or hastened the development of many trends 
              of a psychological, economic, and political nature” (Coles 263).&nbsp; 
              </span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: IT; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">The 
              mere fact that Irving was catering to the tastes of two different 
              audiences at the same time suggests that it must have taken more 
              than average writing skills to make the work appealing to both. 
              The success of the work both in England and America, especially 
              when both the audiences of the time were quite hostile to each other, 
              in itself suggests that the author must have deduced the possible 
              audience response and then written the work to dispel any negative 
              fee</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: IT; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">lings

              every author tend to keep in mind what the audience wants, or what 
              would sell, and then write a work? It's a justified question, but 
              there is one anomaly here which must be kept in mind: the author 
              (or the narrator) of <i>The Sketch Book</i> goes out of his way 
              to present the work as spontaneous, unembellished impressions of 
              a traveler. Thus, Irving is presenting a highly sophisticated work 
              in a very nonchalant way as if the work isn't very accomplished 
              or finished. This leads one to yet another question as to why he 
              does that? It can be said, in a nutshell, that this form of presentation 
              is aimed at creating a lowered horizon of expectation for the reader. 
              Thus, when the reader enters the work, it's with a mind set of the 
              one looking at an unfinished, unpolished work--even though the work 
              is highly embellished and sophisticated--the work surprises the 
              reader because it turns out to be better than expected. This reverse 
              effect is achieved through different techniques, and the title of 
              the work happens to be the first carefully placed trap-door through 
              which the reader is lured into the work.</font></span></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>

              term <u>sketch-book</u> means that&nbsp; the book contains essays 
              or studies of more or less descriptive nature, but the usage of 
              the word 'sketch' implies a preliminary study or a representation 
              of a work of art intended for elaboration; and while a sketch may 
              have line, shading, and color, it connotes hastiness, and incompleteness.</span></font></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="1" face="Verdana" color="#990033"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: IT; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA" lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: IT; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Thus, 
              to a reader the title of the work itself would tend to suggest that 
              <i>The Sketch Book</i> is a compilation of unfinished sketches, 
              and, therefore, not subject to thorough scrutiny meant for a more 
              sophisticated work. The irony is that even though it is called <i>The 
              Sketch Book</i>, the prose and narrative style in the book is highly 
              sophisticated, which leads the reader to appreciate the work better 
              simply because it turns out to be more than expected. Thus, it can 
              be said that even the title of the work is a very carefully crafted 
              way of ensuring a less critical response from a potential reader, 
              and at the same time allowing the author to say--in case of a negative 
              review--that after all it is just a sketch book. </span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: IT; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">The 
              title, therefore, is meant to work in favor of the author, or otherwise

              must also be noted that Irving doesn't attribute the work to himself; 
              instead he qualifies the title <i>The Sketch Book</i> with an annotation 
              suggesting it to be<i>The Sketch Book</i> of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. 
              Thus, the whole work happens to be the observations of this gentleman, 
              who, of course, is fictional but serves a very important purpose. 
              Geoffrey Crayon is &quot;the shy spectator who wishes he had close 
              friends or relatives, the aging bachelor who</span> would half like 
              to be married, the American in England searching for a past...He 
              serves as a go between .…for American readers and British writers; 
              he mediates between past and present,&quot; (Hedges 129), thus becoming 
              a central figure in the whole work, and <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: IT; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">lending 
              it coherence. Crayon also serves the purpose of being a shield, 
              or a screen between Irving and the audience. As explained earlier, 
              Irving wrote <i>The Sketch Book</i> while he was in England, he 
              therefore had to walk a very balanced path ensuring that he neither 
              offended his hosts, nor his countrymen. </span>The persona of Geoffrey 
              Crayon allows Irving the freedom of action, which he otherwise would 
              have not had if he had been the narrator himself.&nbsp; <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: IT; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">Since 
              Mr. Crayon is a gentleman--as it is carefully pointed out in the 
              title--it allows Irving, to &quot; write like a gentleman&quot; 
              (375). Thus, hypothetically if the British gentry and educated classes 
              questioned the authorship of the work simply on the grounds that 
              Irving was not truly a gentleman in English sense, Irving could 
              have said that these were the writings from the point of view of 
              Geoffrey Crayon, who of course, happens to be a gentleman. On the 
              other hand if objected by the American audience for romanticizing 
              English heritage--especially in the backdrop of the war of 1812--he 
              could have quite conveniently replied that the ideas expressed in 
              <i>The Sketch Book </i>were actually the ideas which someone like 
              Geoffrey Crayon Gent. would have, under those circumstances. Thus, 
              simply by attributing the whole work to a self created person, Irving 
              uses a potent device to meet a two-pronged critical response from 
              British and American audiences. This usage of a fictional person 
              cannot just be termed as a mere coincidence. After all why would 
              Irving use such a person, at a time when he did want to take credit 
              for his writings--if not as a technique of defense against possible 
              criticism? The use of person, however, allows Irving the room to 
              take credit if the work were successful (which it was). But if the 
              work had drawn strong cr</span>iticism, Irving would have Geoffrey 
              Crayon to blame, for he could have said that he had tried to capture 
              images as some one like Mr. Crayon would see them.</span></font></p>
