            25, 1903 Motihari - India 
            <p>+ January 21, 1950 London - GB</p>
            <p>Eric Arthur Blair (later George Orwell) was born in 1903 in the 
              Indian village of Motihari, which lies near the border of Nepal. 
              At that time India was a part of the British Empire, and Blair's 
              father, Richard, held a post as an agent in the Opium Department 
              of the Indian Civil Service. The Blairs led a relatively privileged 
              and fairly pleasant life, helping to administer the Empire. The 
              Blair family was not very wealthy - Orwell later described them 
              ironically as &quot;lower-upper-middle class&quot;. In 1907, when 
              Eric was about eight years old, the family returned to England and 
              lived at Henley, though the father continued to work in India until 
              he retired in 1912. With some difficulty, Blair's parents sent their 
              son to a private preparatory school in Sussex at the age of eight. 
              At the age of thirteen he won a scholarship to Wellington, and soon 
              after, another to Eton, the famous public school. </p>
            <p>He had finished the final examinations at Eton as number 138 of 
              167. He neglected to win a university scholarship, and in 1922 Eric 
              Blair joined the Indian Imperial Police. In doing so he was already 
              breaking away from the path most of his school-fellows would take, 
              for Eton often led to either Oxford or Cambridge. Instead, he was 
              drawn to a life of travel and action. He trained in Burma, and served 
              there in the police force for five years. In 1927, while home on 
              leave, he resigned. </p>
            <p>Back in London he settled down in a grotty bedroom in Portobello 
              Road. There, at the age of twenty-four, he started to teach himself 
              how to write. His neighbours were impressed by his determination 
              . Week after week he remained in his unheated bedroom, thawing his 
              hands over a candle when they became too numb to write. In spring 
              of 1928, he turned his back on his own inherited values by taking 
              a drastic step. For more than one year he lived among the poor, 
              first in London, then in Paris. In Paris he lived and worked in 
              a working-class quarter. At that time, Paris was full of artists 
              and would-be artists. There Orwell led a life that was far from 
              bohemian; when he eventually got a job, he worked as a dishwasher. 
            </p>
            <p>When he returned to London, he lived for a couple of months among 
              the tramps and poor people there.<img src="orwell101.jpg" width="235" height="300" align="right"> 
              At his visit he announced that he was going to write a book about 
              his time in Paris. After two rejections from publishers Orwell wrote 
              Burmese Days (published in 1934), a book based on his experiences 
              in the colonial service. </p>
            <p>Orwell's reasons for taking the name Orwell are much more complicated 
              than those that writers usually have when adopting a pen-name. In 
              effect, it meant that Eric Blair would somehow have to shed his 
              old identity and take on a new. This is exactly what he tried to 
              do: he tried to change himself from Eric Blair, old Etonian and 
              English colonial policemen, into George Orwell, classless anti-authoritarian. 
            </p>
            <p>He went to Spain at the end of 1936, with the idea of writing newspaper 
              articles on the Civil War, which had broken out there. The conflict 
              in Spain was between the communist, socialist Republic, and General 
              Franco's Fascist military rebellion. When Orwell arrived in Barcelona 
              he was astonished by the atmosphere he found there: what had seemed 
              impossible in England seemed a fact of daily life in Spain. Class 
              distinctions seemed to have vanished. There was a shortage of everything, 
              but there was equality. Orwell joined in the struggle by enlisting 
              in the militia of the POUM (Partido Obrero de Unificaci&oacute;n 
              de Marxista), which was associated with the British Labour Party 
              For the first time in his life socialism seemed a reality, something 
              for which it was worth fighting for. Orwell received a basic military 
              training and was sent to the front in Aragon, near Zaragoza. He 
              spent a couple of dull months there, and he was wounded in the throat. 
              Three and a half months later, when he returned to Barcelona, he 
              found it a changed city. No longer a place where the socialist word 
              &quot;comrade&quot; was really felt to mean something, it was a 
              city returning to &quot;normal&quot;. Even worse, he was to find 
              that the group he was with, the POUM, was now accused of being a 
              Fascist militia, secretly helping Franco. Orwell had to sleep in 
              the open to avoid showing his papers, and eventually managed to 
              escape into France with his wife. His account of his time in Spain 
              was published in Homage to Catalonia (1938). His experiences in 
              Spain left two impressions on Orwell's mind: firstly, they showed 
              him that socialism in action was a human possibility, if only a 
              temporary one. He never forgot the exhilaration of those first days 
              in Barcelona, when a new society seemed possible, where &quot;comradeship&quot;, 
              instead of being just a socialist abuse of language, was reality. 
              But secondly he saw the experience of the city returning to normal 
              as a gloomy confirmation of the fact that there will always be different 
              classes, that there is something in the human nature that seeks 
              violence, conflict, power over others. It is clear that these two 
              impressions, of hope on the one hand, and despair on the other are 
              entirely contradictory. Nevertheless, despite the despair and confusion 
              of his return to Barcelona (there were street fights between different 
              groups of socialists), Orwell left Spain with a hopeful impression. 
            </p>
            <p><img src="orwell02.jpg" width="362" height="300" align="right">In 
              1939 the war between England and Germany broke out. Orwell wanted 
              to fight, as he has done in Spain, against the fascist enemy, but 
              he was declared physically unfit. In 1941 he joined the British 
              Broadcasting Corporation as talks producer in the Indian section 
              of the eastern service. He served in the Home Guard, a wartime civilian 
              body for local defence. In 1943 he left the BBC to become literary 
              editor of the Tribune and began writing Animal Farm. In 1944 the 
              Orwells adopted a son, but in 1945 his wife died during an operation. 
              Towards the end of the war, Orwell went to Europe as a reporter. 
              Late in 1945 he went to the island of Jura off the Scottish coast, 
              and settled there in 1946. He wrote Nineteen Eighty-Four there. 
              The island's climate was unsuitable for someone suffering from tuberculosis 
              and Nineteen Eighty-Four reflects the bleakness of human suffering, 
              the indignity of pain. Indeed, he said that the book wouldn't have 
              been so gloomy had he not been so ill. Later that year he married 
              Sonia Brownell. He died in January 1950.</p>
            <p><b>1984</b></p>
            <p><i><b>Big Brother</b></i></p>
            <p>Big Brother is not a real person. All-present as he is, all-powerful 
              and forever watching, he is only seen on TV. Although his picture 
              glares out from huge posters that shout, BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING 
              YOU, nobody sees Big Brother in person. Orwell had several things 
              in mind when he created Big Brother. He was certainly thinking of 
              Russian leader Joseph Stalin; the pictures of Big Brother even look 
              like him. He was also thinking of Nazi leader Adolph Hitler and 
              Spanish dictator Francisco Franco. Big Brother stands for dictators 
              everywhere. Orwell may have been thinking about figures in certain 
              religious faiths when he drew Big Brother. The mysterious, powerful, 
              God-like figure who sees and knows everything - but never appears 
              in person. To Inner Party members, Big Brother is a leader, a bogeyman 
              they can use to scare the people, and their authorisation for doing 
              whatever they want. If anybody asks, they can say they are under 
              orders from Big Brother. For the unthinking proles, Big Brother 
              is a distant authority figure. For Winston, Big Brother is an inspiration. 
              Big Brother excites and energises Winston, who hates him. He is 
              also fascinated by Big Brother and drawn to him in some of the same 
              ways that he is drawn to O'Brien, developing a love-hate response 
              to both of them that leads to his downfall.</p>
            <p><i><b>The Party</b></i></p>
            <p>The Party of Oceania is made up of about 19% of the whole population 
              of Oceania's mainland. Generally, one could divide the Party into 
              the Inner Party, which is comparable to the communist nomenclature, 
              and the Outer Party. Winston Smith himself is a member of the Outer 
              Party. The members of the Inner Party hold high posts in the administration 
              of the country. They earn comparably much money, and there isn't 
              a lack of anything in their homes, which look like palaces. The 
              people of the Outer Party live in dull grey and old flats. Because 
              of the war there is often a lack of the most essential things. The 
              life of the Outer Party is dictated by the Party, even their spare 
              time is used by the Party. There are so-called community hikes, 
              community games and all sorts of other activities. And refusing 
              participation in this activities is even dangerous. The life of 
              a Party member is dictated from his birth to his death. The Party 
              even takes children away from their parents to educate them in the 
              ideology of Ingsoc. (One can find this also in the communist future 
              plans.) The children are taught in school to report it to the Thought 
              Police when their parents have unorthodox thoughts, so-called &quot;thoughtcrimes&quot;. 
              After their education, Party members start to work mainly for one 
              of the four Ministries (Minipax, Minitrue, Miniluv, Miniplenty). 
              The further life of a &quot;comrade&quot; continues under the watchful 
              eyes of the Party. Everything people do is recorded by the telescreens. 
              Even in their homes people have telescreens. Each unorthodox action 
              is then punished by &quot;joycamps&quot; (Newspeak word for &quot;forced 
              labour camps&quot;). </p>
            <p><i><b>Proles</b></i></p>
            <p>The proles make up about 81% of the population of Oceania. The 
              Party itself is only interested in their labour, because the proles 
              are mainly employed in industry and on farms. Without their labour, 
              Oceania would break down. Despite this fact, the Party completely 
              ignores this social caste. The curious thing about this behaviour 
              is that the Party calls itself socialist, and generally socialism 
              (at least in the beginning and middle of this century) is a movement 
              of the proletariat. So one could say that the Party abuses the word 
              &quot;Ingsoc&quot;. Orwell again had pointed at another regime, 
              the Nazis, who had put &quot;socialism&quot; into their name. One 
              of the main phrases of the Party is &quot;Proles and animals are 
              free&quot;. In Oceania, the proles live in very desolate and poor 
              quarters. Compared with the districts where the members of the Party 
              live, there are far fewer telescreens, and policemen. And as long 
              as the proles don't commit crimes (crimes in our sense, not in the 
              sense of the party - Thoughtcrime) they don't have any contact with 
              the state. Therefore in the districts of the proletarians one can 
              find things that are abolished and forbidden to Party members. For 
              example, old books, old furniture, prostitution and alcohol (mainly 
              beer) Except &quot;Victory Gin&quot; all of these things are not 
              available to Party members. The proletarians don't participate in 
              the technological development. They live like they used to do many 
              years ago. To my mind, the Party ignores the Proles because they 
              pose no danger to their rule. The working class is too uneducated 
              and too unorganised to pose any real threat. So there is not really 
              a need to change the political attitudes of this class.</p>
            <p><i><b>Newspeak</b></i></p>
            <p>Newspeak is the official language of Oceania and has been devised 
              to meet ideological needs of Ingsoc, or English Socialism. In the 
              year 1984, nobody really uses Newspeak in speech nor in writing. 
              Only the leading articles are written in this &quot;language&quot;. 
              But it is generally assumed that in the year 2050 Newspeak will 
              replace Oldspeak, or common English. The purpose of Newspeak is 
              not only to provide a medium of expression for the world-view and 
              mental habits proper to devotees of Ingsoc, but to make all other 
              methods of thought impossible. Another reason for developing Newspeak 
              is to make old books, or books which were written before the era 
              of the Party, unreadable. With Newspeak, Doublethink will be even 
              easier. Its vocabulary is constructed so as to give exact and often 
              very subtle expression to every meaning that a Party member could 
              properly wish to express, while excluding all other meanings and 
              also the possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods. This 
              is done partly by the invention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating 
              undesirable words by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox 
              meanings whatever. Generally Newspeak words are divided into three 
              groups: the A, B(also called compound words) and the C Vocabulary. 
            </p>
            <p><i><b>Doublethink</b></i></p>
            <p><img src="orwell03.jpg" width="223" height="300" align="left">Doublethink 
              is a kind of manipulation of the mind. Generally, one could say 
              that Doublethink makes people accept contradictions, and it makes 
              them also believe that the party is the only institution that distinguishes 
              between right and wrong. This manipulation is mainly done by the 
              Minitrue (Ministry of Truth), where Winston Smith works. When a 
              person that is well grounded in Doublethink recognizes a contradiction 
              or a lie by the Party, then the person thinks that he is remembering 
              a false fact. The use of the word Doublethink involves doublethink. 
              With the help of the Minitrue, it is not only possible to change 
              written facts, but also facts that are remembered by people. So 
              complete control of the country and its citizens is provided. The 
              fact of faking history had already been used by the Nazis, who told 
              the people that already German Knights believed in the principles 
              of National Socialism.</p>
            <p><i><b>Symbolism</b></i></p>
            <p>In &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; Orwell draws a picture of a 
              totalitarian future. Although the action takes place in the future, 
              there are a couple of elements and symbols taken from the present 
              and past. So, for example, Emmanuel Goldstein, the main enemy of 
              Oceania, is, as one can see from the name, a Jew. Orwell draws a 
              link to other totalitarian systems of our century, like the Nazis 
              and the Communists, who had anti-Semitic ideas, and who used Jews 
              as so-called scapegoats, who were responsible for all bad and evil 
              things in the country. This fact also shows that totalitarian systems 
              want to arbitrate their perfection. Emmanuel Goldstein somehow also 
              stands for Trotsky, a leader of the Revolution, who was later declared 
              an enemy. Another symbol that can be found in Nineteen Eighty-Four 
              is the fact that Orwell divides the fictional superstates in the 
              book according to the division that can be found during the Cold 
              War. So Oceania stands for the United States of America , Eurasia 
              for Russia and Eastasia for China. The fact that the two socialist 
              countries Eastasia and Eurasia (in our case Russia and China) are 
              at war with each other, corresponds to our history (Usuri river). 
              Other, non-historical symbols can be found. One of these symbols 
              is the paperweight that Winston buys in the old junk-shop. It stands 
              for the fragile little world that Winston and Julia have made for 
              each other. They are the coral inside of it. As Orwell wrote: &quot;It 
              is a little chunk of history, that they have forgotten to alter&quot;. 
              The &quot;Golden Country&quot; is another symbol. It stands for 
              the old European pastoral landscape. The place where Winston and 
              Julia meet for the first time to make love to each other, is exactly 
              like the &quot;Golden Country&quot; of Winston's dreams.</p>
            <p><b><img src="animifam.gif" width="150" height="223" align="left">THE 
              ANIMAL FARM</b></p>
            <p>The novel Animal Farm is a satire of the Russian revolution, and 
              therefore full of symbolism. Generally, Orwell associates certain 
              real characters with the characters of the book. Here is a list 
              of the characters and things and their meaning: </p>
            <p>Mr Jones: Mr Jones is one of Orwell's major (or at least most obvious) 
              villain in Animal Farm. Orwell says that at one time Jones was actually 
              a decent master to his animals. At this time the farm was thriving. 
              But in recent years the farm had fallen on harder times and the 
              opportunity was seen to revolt. The world-wide depression began 
              in the United States when the stock market crashed in October of 
              1929. The depression spread throughout the world because American 
              exports were so dependent on Europe. The U.S. was also a major contributor 
              to the world market economy. Germany along with the rest of Europe 
              was especially hard hit. The parallels between crop failure of the 
              farm and the depression in the 1930s are clear. Only the leaders 
              and the die-hard followers ate their fill during this time period. 
              Mr Jones symbolises (in addition to the evils of capitalism) Czar 
              Nicholas II, the leader before Stalin (Napoleon). Jones represents 
              the old government, the last of the Czars. Orwell suggests that 
              Jones was losing his &quot;edge&quot;. In fact, he and his men had 
              taken up the habit of drinking. Old Major reveals his feelings about 
              Jones and his administration when he says, &quot;Man is the only 
              creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, 
              he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot 
              run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the animals. 
              He sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare minimum that 
              will prevent them from starving and the rest he keeps for himself.&quot; 
              So Jones and the old government are successfully uprooted by the 
              animals. Little do they know history will repeat itself with Napoleon 
              and the pigs. </p>
            <p>Old Major: Old Major is the first major character described by 
              Orwell in Animal Farm. This &quot;pure-bred&quot; of pigs is the 
              kind, grandfatherly philosopher of change - an obvious metaphor 
              for Karl Marx. Old Major proposes a solution to the animals' desperate 
              plight under the Jones &quot;administration&quot; when he inspires 
              a rebellion of sorts among the animals. Of course the actual time 
              of the revolt is untold. It could be the next day or several generations 
              down the road. But Old Major's philosophy is only an ideal. After 
              his death, three days after the barn-yard speech, the socialism 
              he professes is drastically altered when Napoleon and the other 
              pigs begin to dominate. It's interesting that Orwell does not mention 
              Napoleon or Snowball at any time during the great speech of old 
              Major. This shows how distant and out-of-touch they really were; 
              the ideals Old Major proclaimed seemed to not even have been considered 
              when they were establishing their new government after the successful 
              revolt. It almost seems as though the pigs fed off old Major's inspiration 
              and then used it to benefit themselves (an interesting twist of 
              capitalism) instead of following through on the old Major's honest 
              proposal. This could be Orwell's attempt to dig Stalin, whom many 
              consider to be someone who totally ignored Marx's political and 
              social theory. Using Old Major's apparent naivety, Orwell concludes 
              that no society is perfect, no pure socialist civilisation can exist, 
              and there is no way to escaping the evil grasp of capitalism. (More 
              on this in the Napoleon section.) Unfortunately, when Napoleon and 
              Squealer take over, old Major becomes more and more a distant fragment 
              of the past in the minds of the farm animals. </p>
            <p>Napoleon: Napoleon is Orwell's chief villain in Animal Farm. The 
              name Napoleon is very appropriate since Napoleon, the dictator of 
              France, was thought by many to be the Anti-Christ. Napoleon, the 
              pig, is really the central character on the farm. Obviously a metaphor 
              for Stalin, Comrade Napoleon represents the human frailties of any 
              revolution. Orwell believed that although socialism is good as an 
              ideal, it can never be successfully adopted due the to uncontrollable 
              sins of human nature. For example, although Napoleon seems at first 
              to be a good leader, he is eventually overcome by greed and soon 
              becomes power-hungry. Of course, Stalin did, too, in Russia, leaving 
              the original equality of socialism behind, giving himself all the 
              power and living in luxury while the common peasant suffered. Thus, 
              while his national and international status blossomed, the welfare 
              of Russia remained unchanged. Orwell explains, &quot;Somehow it 
              seemed as though the farm had grown richer without making the animals 
              themselves any richer--except, of course for the pigs and the dogs.&quot; 
              The true side of Napoleon becomes evident after he slaughters so 
              many animals for plotting against him. He even hires a pig to sample 
              his food for him to make certain that no one is trying to poison 
              him. Stalin, too, was a cruel dictator in Russia. After suspecting 
              many people in his empire to be supporters of Trotsky (Orwell's 
              Snowball), Stalin systematically murdered many. At the end of the 
              book, Napoleon doesn't even pretend to lead a socialist state. After 
              renaming it a Republic and instituting his own version of the commandments 
              and the Beasts of England, Comrade Napoleon quickly becomes more 
              or less a dictator who of course has never even been elected by 
              the animals. </p>
            <p>Squealer: Squealer is an intriguing character in Orwell's Animal 
              Farm. He's first described as a manipulator and persuader. Orwell 
              narrates, &quot;He could turn black into white.&quot; Many critics 
              correlate Squealer with the Pravda, the Russian newspaper of the 
              1930s. Propaganda was a key to many publications, and since there 
              was no television or radio, the newspaper was the primary source 
              of media information. So the monopoly of the Pravda was seized by 
              Stalin and his new Bolshevik regime. In Animal Farm, Squealer, like 
              the newspaper, is the link between Napoleon and other animals. When 
              Squealer masks the evil intentions of the pigs, the intentions can 
              be carried out with little resistance and without political disarray. 
              Squealer is also thought by some to represent Goebbels, who was 
              the minister of propaganda for Germany. This would seem inconsistent 
              with Orwell's satire, however, which was supposed to metaphor characters 
              in Russia. </p>
            <p>Snowball: Orwell describes Snowball as a pig very similar to Napoleon 
              at least in the early stages. Both pigs wanted a leadership position 
              in the &quot;new&quot; economic and political system (which is actually 
              contradictory to the whole supposed system of equality). But as 
              time passes, both eventually realise that one of them will have 
              to step down. Orwell says that the two were always arguing. &quot;Snowball 
              and Napoleon were by far the most active in the debates. But it 
              was noticed that these two were never in agreement: whatever suggestion 
              either of them made, the other could be counted to oppose it.&quot; 
              Later, Orwell makes the case stronger. &quot;These two disagreed 
              at every point disagreement was possible.&quot; Soon the differences, 
              like whether or not to build a windmill, become too great to deal 
              with, so Napoleon decides that Snowball must be eliminated. It might 
              seem that this was a spontaneous reaction, but a careful look tells 
              otherwise. Napoleon was setting the stage for his own domination 
              long before he really began &quot;dishing it out&quot; to Snowball. 
              For example, he took the puppies away from their mothers in an effort 
              to establish a private police force. These dogs would later be used 
              to eliminate Snowball, his arch-rival. Snowball represents Leo Trotsky, 
              the arch-rival of Stalin in Russia. The parallels between Trotsky 
              and Snowball are uncanny. Trotsky too, was exiled, not from the 
              farm, but to Mexico, where he spoke out against Stalin. Stalin was 
              very weary of Trotsky and feared that Trotsky supporters might try 
              to assassinate him. The dictator of Russia tried hard to kill Trotsky, 
              for the fear of losing leadership was very great in the crazy man's 
              mind. Trotsky also believed in communism, but he thought he could 
              run Russia better than Stalin. Trotsky was murdered in Mexico by 
              the Russian internal police, the NKVD - the precursor of the KGB. 
              Trotsky was found with a pick axe in his head at his villa in Mexico. 
            </p>
            <p>Boxer: The name Boxer is cleverly used by Orwell as a metaphor 
              for the Boxer Rebellion in China in the early twentieth century. 
              It was this rebellion which signalled the beginning of communism 
              in red China. This form of communism, much like the distorted Stalin 
              view of socialism, is still present today in the oppressive socialist 
              government in China. Boxer and Clover are used by Orwell to represent 
              the proletariat, or unskilled labour class in Russian society. This 
              lower class is naturally drawn to Stalin (Napoleon) because it seems 
              as though they will benefit most from his new system. Since Boxer 
              and the other low animals are not accustomed to the &quot;good life,&quot; 
              they can't really compare Napoleon's government with the life they 
              had before under the czars (Jones). Also, since usually the lowest 
              class has the lowest intelligence, it is not difficult to persuade 
              them into thinking they are getting a good deal. The proletariat 
              is also quite good at convincing themselves that communism is a 
              good idea. Orwell supports this contention when he narrates, &quot;Their 
              most faithful disciples were the two carthorses, Boxer and Clover. 
              Those two had great difficulty in thinking anything out for themselves, 
              but having once accepted the pigs as their teachers, they absorbed 
              everything that they were told, and passed it on to the other animals 
              by simple arguments.&quot; Later, the importance of the proletariat 
              is shown when Boxer suddenly falls and there is suddenly a drastic 
              decrease in work productivity. But still he is taken for granted 
              by the pigs, who send him away in a glue truck. Truly Boxer is the 
              biggest poster-child for gullibility. </p>
            <p>Pigs: Orwell uses the pigs to surround and support Napoleon. They 
              symbolise the communist party loyalists and the friends of Stalin, 
              as well as perhaps the Duma, or Russian parliament. The pigs, unlike 
              other animals, live in luxury and enjoy the benefits of the society 
              they help to control. The inequality and true hypocrisy of communism 
              is expressed here by Orwell, who criticised Marx's oversimplified 
              view of a socialist, &quot;utopian&quot; society. Obviously, George 
              Orwell doesn't believe such a society can exist. Toward the end 
              of the book, Orwell emphasises, &quot;Somehow it seemed as though 
              the farm had grown richer without making the animals themselves 
              any richer except, of course, the pigs and the dogs.&quot; </p>
            <p>Dogs: Orwell uses the dogs in his book, Animal Farm, to represent 
              the KGB or perhaps more accurately, the bodyguards of Stalin. The 
              dogs are the arch-defenders of Napoleon and the pigs, and although 
              they don't speak, they are definitely a force the other animals 
              have to reckon with. Orwell almost speaks of the dogs as mindless 
              robots, so dedicated to Napoleon that they can't really speak for 
              themselves. This contention is supported as Orwell describes Napoleon's 
              early and suspicious removal of six puppies from their mother. The 
              reader is left in the dark for a while, but is later enlightened 
              when Orwell describes the chase of Snowball. Napoleon uses his &quot;secret 
              dogs&quot; for the first time here; before Snowball has a chance 
              to stand up and give a counter-argument to Napoleon's disapproval 
              of the windmill, the dogs viciously attack the pig, forcing him 
              to flee, never to return again. Orwell narrates, &quot;Silent and 
              terrified, the animals crept back into the barn. In a moment the 
              dogs came bounding back. At first no one had been able to imagine 
              where these creatures came from, but the problem was soon solved: 
              they were the puppies whom Napoleon had taken away from their mothers 
              and reared privately. Though not yet full-grown, they were huge 
              dogs, and as fierce-looking as wolves. They kept close to Napoleon. 
              It was noticed that they wagged their tails to him in the same way 
              as the other dogs had been used to do to Mr Jones.&quot; The use 
              of the dogs begins the evil use of force which helps Napoleon maintain 
              power. Later, the dogs do even more dastardly things when they are 
              instructed to kill the animals labelled &quot;disloyal.&quot; Stalin, 
              too, had his own special force of &quot;helpers&quot;. Really there 
              are followers loyal to any politician or government leader, but 
              Stalin in particular needed a special police force to eliminate 
              his opponents. This is how Trotsky was killed. </p>
            <p>Mollie: Mollie is one of Orwell's minor characters, but she represents 
              something very important. Mollie is one of the animals who is most 
              opposed to the new government under Napoleon. She doesn't care much 
              about the politics of the whole situation; she just wants to tie 
              her hair with ribbons and eat sugar, things her social status won't 
              allow. Many animals consider her a traitor when she is seen being 
              petted by a human from a neighbouring farm. Soon Mollie is confronted 
              by the &quot;dedicated&quot; animals, and she quietly leaves the 
              farm. Mollie characterises the typical middle-class skilled worker 
              who suffers from this new communism concept. No longer will she 
              get her sugar (nice salary) because she is now just as low as the 
              other animals, like Boxer and Clover. Orwell uses Mollie to characterise 
              the people after any rebellion who aren't too receptive to new leaders 
              and new economics. There are always those resistant to change. This 
              continues to dispel the belief Orwell hated and according to which 
              basically all animals act the same. The naivety of Marxism is criticised, 
              socialism is not perfect, and it doesn't work for everyone. </p>
            <p>Moses: Moses is perhaps Orwell's most intriguing character in Animal 
              Farm. This raven, first described as the &quot;especial pet&quot; 
              of Mr Jones, is the only animal who doesn't work. He's also the 
              only character who doesn't listen to Old Major's speech of rebellion. 
              Orwell narrates, &quot;The pigs had an even harder struggle to counteract 
              the lies put about by Moses, the tame raven. Moses, who was Mr Jones's 
              especial pet, was a spy and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever 
              talker. He claimed to know of the existence of a mysterious country 
              called Sugarcandy Mountain, to which all animals went when they 
              died. It was situated somewhere up in the sky, a little distance 
              beyond the clouds, Moses said. In Sugarcandy Mountain it was Sunday 
              seven days a week, clover was in season all the year round, and 
              lump sugar and linseed cake grew on the hedges. The animals hated 
              Moses because he told tales and did no work but some of them believed 
              in Sugarcandy Mountain, and the pigs had to argue very hard to persuade 
              them that there was no such place.&quot; Moses represents Orwell's 
              view of the Church. To Orwell, the Church is just used as a tool 
              by dictatorships to keep the working class of people hopeful and 
              productive. Orwell uses Moses to criticize Marx's belief that the 
              Church will just go away after the rebellion. Jones first used Moses 
              to keep the animals working, and he was successful in many ways 
              before the rebellion. The pigs had a real hard time getting rid 
              of Moses, since the lies about Heaven they thought would only lead 
              the animals away from the equality of socialism. But as the pigs 
              led by Napoleon become more and more like Mr Jones, Moses finds 
              his place again. After being away for several years, he suddenly 
              returns and picks up right where he left off. The pigs don't mind 
              this time because the animals have already realised that the &quot;equality&quot; 
              of the revolt is a farce. So Napoleon feeds Moses with beer, and 
              the full circle is complete. Orwell seems to offer a very cynical 
              and harsh view of the Church. This proves that Animal Farm is not 
              simply an anti-communist work meant to lead people into capitalism 
              and Christianity. Really Orwell found loop-holes and much hypocrisy 
              in both systems. It's interesting that recently in Russia the government 
              has begun to allow and support religion again. It almost seems that 
              like the pigs, the Kremlin officials of today are trying to keep 
              their people motivated, not in the ideology of communism, but in 
              the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; hope of an after-life. </p>
            <p>Muriel: Muriel is a knowledgeable goat who reads the commandments 
              for Clover. Muriel represents the minority of working class people 
              who are educated enough to decide things for themselves and find 
              critical and hypocritical problems with their leaders. Unfortunately 
              for the other animals, Muriel is not charismatic or inspired enough 
              to take action and oppose Napoleon and his pigs. </p>
            <p>Old Benjamin: Old Benjamin, an elderly donkey, is one of Orwell's 
              most elusive and intriguing characters on Animal Farm. He is described 
              as rather unchanged since the rebellion. He still does his work 
              the same way, never becoming too excited or too disappointed about 
              anything that has passed. Benjamin explains, &quot;Donkeys live 
              a long time. None of you has ever seen a dead donkey.&quot; Although 
              there is no clear metaphoric relationship between Benjamin and Orwell's 
              critique of communism, it makes sense that during any rebellion 
              there are those who never totally embrace the revolution, those 
              so cynical they no longer look to their leaders for help. Benjamin 
              symbolises the older generation, the critics of any new rebellion. 
              Really this old donkey is the only animal who seems as though he 
              couldn't care less about Napoleon and Animal Farm. It's almost as 
              if he can see into the future, knowing that the revolt is only a 
              temporary change, and will flop in the end. Benjamin is the only 
              animal who doesn't seem to have expected anything positive from 
              the revolution. He almost seems on a whole different maturity level 
              compared with the other animals. He is not sucked in by Napoleon's 
              propaganda like the others. The only time he seems to care about 
              the others at all is when Boxer is carried off in the glue truck. 
              It's almost as if the old donkey finally comes out of his shell, 
              his perfectly fitted demeanour, when he tries to warn the others 
              of Boxer's fate. And the animals do try to rescue Boxer, but it's 
              too late. Benjamin seems to be finally confronting Napoleon and 
              revealing his knowledge of the pigs' hypocrisy, although before 
              he had been completely independent. After the animals have forgotten 
              Jones and their past lives, Benjamin still remembers everything. 
              Orwell states, &quot;Only old Benjamin professed to remember every 
              detail of his long life and to know that things never had been, 
              nor ever could be much better or much worse; hunger, hardship, and 
              disappointment being, so he said, the unalterable law of life.&quot;</p>
