    <td width="600"> Mr. Anderson said, &quot;Where's Jimmy, dear?&quot; <br>	
      &quot;Out on the crater,&quot; said Mrs. Anderson. &quot;Hell be all right 
      Robutt is with him.-Did he arrive?&quot; <br> &quot;Yes. He's at the rocket 
      station, going through the tests. Actually, I can hardly wait to see him 
      myself. I haven't really seen one since I left Earth 15 years ago. You can't 
      count films.&quot; <br> &quot;Jimmy has never seen one,&quot; said Mrs. 
      Anderson. <br> &quot;Because he's Moonborn and can't visit Earth. That's 
      why I'm bringing one here. I think it's the first one ever on the Moon.&quot; 
      <br> &quot;It cost enough,&quot; said Mrs. Anderson, with a small sigh. 
      &quot;Maintaining Robutt isn't cheap, either,&quot; said Mr. Anderson. <br>
      Jimmy was out on the crater, as his mother had said. By Earth standards, 
      he was spindly, but rather tall for a 10-year-old. His arms and legs were 
      long and agile. He looked thicker and stubbier with his spacesuit on, but 
      he could handle the lunar gravity as no Earth-born human being could. His 
      father couldn't begin to keep up with him when Jimmy stretched his legs 
      and went into the kangaroo hop. <br>
      The outer side of the crater sloped southward and the Earth, which was low 
      in the southern sky (where it always was, as seen from Lunar City) was nearly 
      full, so that the entire crater-slope was brightly lit <br>
      The slope was a gentle one and even the weight of the spacesuit couldn't 
      keep Jimmy from racing up it in a floating hop that made the gravity seem 
      nonexistent.<br> &quot;Come on, Robutt,&quot; he shouted. <br>
      Robutt, who could hear him by radio, squeaked and bounded after. <br>
      Jimmy, expert though he was, couldn't outrace Robutt, who didn't need a 
      spacesuit, and had four legs and tendons of steel. Robutt sailed over Jimmy's 
      head, somersaulting and landing almost under his feet. <br> &quot;Don't 
      show off, Robutt,&quot; said Jimmy, &quot;and stay in sight.&quot; <br>
      Robutt squeaked again, the special squeak that meant &quot;Yes.&quot; <br>	
      &quot;I don't trust you, you faker,&quot; shouted Jimmy, and up he went 
      in one last bound that carried him over the curved upper edge of the crater 
      wall and down onto the inner slope. <br>
      The Earth sank below the top of the crater wall and at once it was pitch-dark 
      around him. A warm, friendly darkness that wiped out the difference between 
      ground and sky except for the glitter of stars. <br>
      Actually, Jimmy wasn't supposed to exercise along the dark side of the crater 
      wall. The grown ups said it was dangerous, but that was because they were 
      never there. The ground was smooth and crunchy and Jimmy knew the exact 
      location of every one of the few rocks. <br>
      Besides, how could it be dangerous racing through the dark when Robutt was 
      right there with him, bouncing around and squeaking and glowing? Even without 
      the glow, Robutt could tell where he was, and where Jimmy was, by radar. 
      Jimmy couldn't go wrong while Robutt was around, tripping him when he was 
      too near a rock, or jumping on him to show how much he loved him, or circling 
      around and squeaking low and scared when Jimmy hid behind a rock, when all 
      the time Robutt knew well enough where he was. Once Jimmy had lain still 
      and pretended he was hurt and Robutt had sounded the radio alarm and people 
      from Lunar City got there in a hurry. Jimmy's father had let him hear about 
      that little trick, and Jimmy never tried it again. <br>
      Just as he was remembering that, he heard his father's voice on his private 
      wavelength. &quot;Jimmy, come back. I have something to tell you.&quot; 
      <br> <br>
      Jimmy was out of his spacesuit now and washed up. You always had to wash 
      up after coming in from outside. Even Robutt had to be sprayed, but he loved 
      it. He stood there on all fours, his little foot-long body quivering and 
      glowing just a tiny bit, and his small head, with no mouth, with two large 
      glassed-in eyes, and with a bump where the brain was. He squeaked until 
      Mr. Anderson said, &quot;Quiet, Robutt.&quot; <br>
      Mr. Anderson was smiling. &quot;We have something for you, Jimmy. It's at 
      the rocket station now, but we'll have it tomorrow after all the tests are 
      over. I thought I'd tell you now.&quot; <br> &quot;From Earth, Dad?&quot; 
      &quot;A dog from Earth, son. A real dog. A Scotch terrier puppy. The first 
      dog on the Moon. You won't need Robutt any more. We can't keep them both, 
      you know, and some other boy or girl will have Robutt.&quot; He seemed to 
      be waiting for Jimmy to say something, then he said, &quot;You know what 
      a dog is, Jimmy. It's the real thing. Robutt's only a mechanical imitation, 
      a robot-mutt. That's how he got his name.&quot; <br>
      Jimmy frowned. &quot;Robutt isn't an imitation, Dad. He's my dog.&quot; 
      &quot;Not a real one, Jimmy. Robutt's just steel and wiring and a simple 
      positronic brain. It's not alive.&quot; <br> &quot;He does everything I 
      want him to do, Dad. He understands me. Sure, he's alive.&quot; <br> &quot;No, 
      son. Robutt is just a machine. It's just programmed to act the way it does. 
      A dog is alive. You won't want Robutt after you have the dog.&quot; <br>	
      &quot;The dog will need a spacesuit, won't he?&quot; &quot;Yes, of course. 
      But it will be worth the money and he'll get used to it. And he won't need 
      one in the City. You'll see the difference once he gets here.&quot; <br>
      Jimmy looked at Robutt, who was squeaking again, a very low, slow squeak, 
      that seemed frightened. Jimmy held out his arms and Robutt was in them in 
      one bound. Jimmy said, &quot;What will the difference be between Robutt 
      and the dog?&quot; <br> &quot;It's hard to explain,&quot; said Mr. Anderson, 
      &quot;but it will be easy to see. The dog will really love you. Robutt is 
      just adjusted to act as though it loves you.&quot; <br> &quot;But, Dad, 
      we don't know what's inside the dog, or what his feelings are. Maybe it's 
      just acting, too.&quot; <br>
      Mr. Anderson frowned. &quot;Jimmy, you'll know the difference when you experience 
      the love of a living thing.&quot; <br>
      Jimmy held Robutt tightly. He was frowning, too, and the desperate look 
      on his face meant that he wouldn't change his mind. He said, &quot;But what's 
      the difference how they act? How about how I feel? I love Robutt and that's 
      what counts.&quot; <br>
      And the little robot-mutt, which had never been held so tightly in all its 
      existence, squeaked high and rapid squeaks-happy squeaks.<br></td>
