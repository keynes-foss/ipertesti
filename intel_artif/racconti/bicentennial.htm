      <p>The Three Laws of Robotics <br>
        1. A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a 
        human being to come to harm. <br>
        2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where 
        such orders would conflict with the First Law.<br>
        3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does 
        not conflict with the First or Second Law. </p>
      <p>1</p>
      <p> Andrew Martin said, &quot;Thank you,&quot; and took the seat offered 
        him. He didn't look driven to the last resort, but he had been.<br>
        He didn't, actually, look anything, for there was a smooth blankness, 
        to his face, except for the sadness one imagined one saw in his eyes. 
        His hair was smooth, light brown, rather fine; and he had no facial hair. 
        He looked freshly and cleanly shaved. His clothes were distinctly old-fashioned, 
        but neat, and predominantly a velvety red-purple in color.<br>
        Facing him from behind the desk was the surgeon. The nameplate on the 
        desk included a fully identifying series of letters and numbers which 
        Andrew didn't bother with. To call him Doctor would be quite enough.<br>
        &quot;When can the operation be carried through, Doctor?&quot; he asked.<br>
        Softly, with that certain inalienable note of respect that a robot always 
        used to a human being, the surgeon said, &quot;I am not certain, sir, 
        that I understand how or upon whom such an operation could be performed.&quot;<br>
        There might have been a look of respectful intransigence on the surgeon's 
        face, if a robot of his sort, in lightly bronzed stainless steel, could 
        have such an expression- or any expression.<br>
        Andrew Martin studied the robot's right hand, his cutting hand, as it 
        lay motionless on the desk. The fingers were long and were shaped into 
        artistically metallic, looping curves so graceful and appropriate that 
        one could imagine a scalpel fitting them and becoming, temporarily, one 
        piece with them. There would be no hesitation in his work, no stumbling, 
        no quivering, no mistakes. That confidence came with specialization, of 
        course, a specialization so fiercely desired by humanity that few robots 
        were, any longer, independently brained. A surgeon, of course, would have 
        to be. But this one, though brained, was so limited in his capacity that 
        he did not recognize Andrew, had probably never heard of him.<br>
        &quot;Have you ever thought you would like to be a man?&quot; Andrew asked.<br>
        The surgeon hesitated a moment, as though the question fitted nowhere 
        in his allotted positronic pathways. &quot;But I am a robot, sir.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Would it be better to be a man?&quot;<br>
        &quot;If would be better, sir, to be a better surgeon. I could not be 
        so if I were a man, but only if I were a more advanced robot. I would 
        be pleased to be a more advanced robot.&quot;<br>
        &quot;It does not offend you that I can order you about? That I can make 
        you stand up, sit down, move right or left, by merely telling you to do 
        so?&quot;<br>
        &quot;It is my pleasure to please you, sir. If your orders were to interfere 
        with my functioning with respect to you or to any other human being, I 
        would not obey you. The First Law, concerning my duty to human safety, 
        would take precedence over the Second Law relating to obedience. Otherwise, 
        obedience is my pleasure. Now, upon whom am I to perform this operation?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Upon me,&quot; Andrew said.<br>
        &quot;But that is impossible. It is patently a damaging operation.&quot;<br>
        &quot;That does not matter,&quot; said Andrew, calmly. &quot;I must not 
        inflict damage,&quot; said the surgeon. &quot;On a human being, you must 
        not,&quot; said Andrew, &quot;but I, too, am a robot.&quot; </p>
      <p>2</p>
      <p> Andrew had appeared much more a robot when he had first been- manufactured. 
        He had then been as much a robot in appearance as any that had ever existed, 
        smoothly designed and functional.<br>
        He had done well in the home to which he had been brought in those days 
        when robots in households, or on the planet altogether, had been a rarity. 
        There had been four in the home: Sir and Ma'am and Miss and Little Miss. 
        He knew their names, of course, but he never used them. Sir was Gerald 
        Martin.<br>
        His own serial number was NDR- He eventually forgot the numbers. It had 
        been a long time, of course; but if he had wanted to remember, he could 
        not have forgotten. He had not wanted to remember.<br>
        Little Miss had been the first to call him Andrew, because she could not 
        use the letters, and all the rest followed her in this.<br>
        Little Miss- She had lived for ninety years and was long since dead. He 
        had tried to call her Ma'am once, but she would not allow it. Little Miss 
        she had been to her last day.<br>
        Andrew had been intended to perform the duties of a valet, a butler, even 
        a lady's maid. Those were the experimental days for him and, indeed, for 
        all robots anywhere save in the industrial and exploratory factories and 
        stations off Earth.<br>
        The Martins enjoyed him, and half the time he was prevented from doing 
        his work because Miss and Little Miss wanted to play with him. It was 
        Miss who first understood how this might be arranged. &quot;We order you 
        to play with us and you must follow orders.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I am sorry, Miss, but a prior order from Sir must surely take precedence.&quot;<br>
        But she said, &quot;Daddy just said he hoped you would take care of the 
        cleaning. That's not much of an order. I order you.&quot;<br>
        Sir did not mind. Sir was fond of Miss and of Little Miss, even more than 
        Ma'am was; and Andrew was fond of them, too. At least, the effect they 
        had upon his actions were those which in a human being would have been 
        called the result of fondness. Andrew thought of it as fondness for he 
        did not know any other word for it.<br>
        It was for Little Miss that Andrew had carved a pendant out of wood. She 
        had ordered him to. Miss, it seemed, had received an ivorite pendant with 
        scrollwork for her birthday and Little Miss was unhappy over it. She had 
        only a piece of wood, which she gave Andrew together with a small kitchen 
        knife.<br>
        He had done it quickly and Little Miss had said, &quot;That's nice, Andrew. 
        I'll show it to Daddy.&quot;<br>
        Sir would not believe it. &quot;Where did you really get this, Mandy?&quot; 
        Mandy was what he called Little Miss. When Little Miss assured him she 
        was really telling the truth, he turned to Andrew. &quot;Did you do this, 
        Andrew?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Yes, Sir.&quot;<br>
        &quot;The design, too?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Yes, Sir.&quot;<br>
        &quot;From what did you copy the design?&quot;<br>
        &quot;It is a geometric representation, Sir, that fits the grain of the 
        wood.&quot;<br>
        The next day, Sir brought him another piece of wood- a larger one- and 
        an electric vibro-knife. &quot;Make something out of this, Andrew. Anything 
        you want to,&quot; he said.<br>
        Andrew did so as Sir watched, then looked at the product a long time. 
        After that, Andrew no longer waited on tables. He was ordered to read 
        books on furniture design instead, and he learned to make cabinets and 
        desks.<br>
        &quot;These are amazing productions, Andrew,&quot; Sir soon told him.<br>
        &quot;I enjoy doing them, Sir,&quot; Andrew admitted.<br>
        &quot;Enjoy?&quot;<br>
        &quot;It makes the circuits of my brain somehow flow more easily. I have 
        heard you use the word `enjoy' and the way you use it fits the way I feel. 
        I enjoy doing them, Sir.&quot; </p>
      <p><br>
        3</p>
      <p> Gerald Martin took Andrew to the regional offices of the United States 
        Robots and Mechanical Men Corporation. As a member of the Regional Legislature 
        he had no trouble at all in gaining an interview with the chief robopsychologist. 
        In fact, it was only as a member of the Regional Legislature that he qualified 
        as a robot owner in the first place- in those early days when robots were 
        rare.<br>
        Andrew did not understand any of this at the time. But in later years, 
        with greater learning, he could re-view that early scene and understand 
        it in its proper light.<br>
        The robopsychologist, Merton Mansky, listened with a growing frown and 
        more than once managed to stop his fingers at the point beyond which they 
        would have irrevocably drummed on the table. He had drawn features and 
        a lined forehead, but he might actually have been younger than he looked.<br>
        &quot;Robotics is not an exact art, Mr. Martin,&quot; Mansky explained. 
        &quot;I cannot explain it to you in detail, but the mathematics governing 
        the plotting of the positronic pathways is far too complicated to permit 
        of any but approximate solutions. Naturally, since we build everything 
        around the Three Laws, those are incontrovertible. We will, of course, 
        replace your robot-&quot;<br>
        &quot;Not at all,&quot; said Sir. &quot;There is no question of failure 
        on his part. He performs his assigned duties perfectly. The point is he 
        also carves wood in exquisite fashion and never the same twice. He produces 
        works of art.&quot;<br>
        Mansky looked confused. &quot;Strange. Of course, we're attempting generalized 
        pathways these days. Really creative, you think?&quot;<br>
        &quot;See for yourself.&quot; Sir handed over a little sphere of wood 
        on which there was a playground scene in which the boys and girls were 
        almost too small to make out, yet they were in perfect proportion and 
        they blended so naturally with the grain that it, too, seemed to have 
        been carved.<br>
        Mansky was incredulous. &quot;He did that?&quot; He handed it back with 
        a shake of his head. &quot;The luck of the draw. Something in the pathways.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Can you do it again?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Probably not. Nothing like this has ever been reported.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Good! I don't in the least mind Andrew's being the only one.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I suspect that the company would like to have your robot back for 
        study,&quot; Mansky said.<br>
        &quot;Not a chance!&quot; Sir said with sudden grimness. &quot;Forget 
        it.&quot; He turned to Andrew, &quot;Let's go home, now.&quot; </p>
      <p><br>
        4</p>
      <p> Miss was dating boys and wasn't about the house much. It was Little 
        Miss, not as little as she once was, who filled Andrew's horizon now. 
        She never forgot that the very first piece of wood carving he had done 
        had been for her. She kept it on a silver chain about her neck.<br>
        It was she who first objected to Sir's habit of giving away Andrew's work. 
        &quot;Come on, Dad, if anyone wants one of them, let him pay for it. It's 
        worth it.&quot;<br>
        &quot;It isn't like you to be greedy, Mandy.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Not for us, Dad. For the artist.&quot;<br>
        Andrew had never heard the word before, and when he had a moment to himself 
        he looked it up in the dictionary.<br>
        Then there was another trip, this time to Sir's lawyer.<br>
        &quot;What do you think of this, John?&quot; Sir asked.<br>
        The lawyer was John Finegold. He had white hair and a pudgy belly, and 
        the rims of his contact lenses were tinted a bright green. He looked at 
        the small plaque Sir had given him. &quot;This is beautiful. But I've 
        already heard the news. Isn't thus a carving made by your robot? The one 
        you've brought with you.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Yes, Andrew does them. Don't you, Andrew?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Yes, Sir,&quot; said Andrew.<br>
        &quot;How much would you pay for that, John?&quot; Sir asked.<br>
        &quot;I can't say. I'm not a collector of such things.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Would you believe I have been offered two hundred and fifty dollars 
        for that small thing. Andrew has made chairs that have sold for five hundred 
        dollars. There's two hundred thousand dollars in the bank from Andrew's 
        products.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Good heavens, he's making you rich, Gerald.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Half rich,&quot; said Sir. &quot;Half of it is in an account in 
        the name of Andrew Martin.&quot;<br>
        &quot;The robot?&quot;<br>
        &quot;That's right, and I want to know if it's legal.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Legal . . . ?&quot; Feingold's chair creaked as he leaned back in 
        it. &quot;There are no precedents, Gerald. How did your robot sign the 
        necessary papers?&quot;<br>
        &quot;He can sign his name. Now, is there anything further that ought 
        to be done?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Um.&quot; Feingold's eyes seemed to turn inward for a moment. Then 
        he said, &quot;Well, we can set up a trust to handle all finances in his 
        name and that will place a layer of insulation between him and the hostile 
        world. Beyond that, my advice is you do nothing. No one has e stopped 
        you so far. If anyone objects, let him bring suit&quot;<br>
        &quot;And will you take the case if the suit is brought?&quot;<br>
        &quot;For a retainer, certainly.&quot;<br>
        &quot;How much?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Something like that,&quot; Feingold said, and pointed to the wooden 
        plaque.<br>
        &quot;Fair enough,&quot; said Sir.<br>
        Feingold chuckled as he turned to the robot. &quot;Andrew, are you pleased 
        that you have money?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;<br>
        &quot;What do you plan to do with it?&quot; Pay for things, sir, which 
        otherwise Sir &quot;would have to pay for. It would save him expense, 
        sir.&quot; </p>
      <p><br>
        5</p>
      <p> Such occasions' arose. Repairs were expensive, and revisions were even 
        more so. With the years, new models of robots were produced and Sir saw 
        to it that Andrew had the advantage of every new device, until he was 
        a model of metallic excellence. It was all done at Andrew's expense. Andrew 
        insisted on that.<br>
        Only his positronic pathways were untouched. Sir insisted on that.<br>
        &quot;The new models aren't as good as you are, Andrew,&quot; he said. 
        &quot;The new robots are worthless. The company has learned to make the 
        pathways more precise, more closely on the nose, more deeply on the track. 
        The new robots don't shift. They do what they're designed for and never 
        stray. I like you better.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Thank you, Sir.&quot;<br>
        &quot;And it's your doing, Andrew, don't you forget that. I am certain 
        Mansky put an end to generalized pathways as soon as he had a good look 
        at you. He didn't like the unpredictability. Do you know how many times 
        he asked for you back so he could place you under study? Nine times! I 
        never let him have you, though; and now that he's retired, we may have 
        some peace.&quot;<br>
        So Sir's hair thinned and grayed and his face grew pouchy, while Andrew 
        looked even better than he had when he first joined the family. Ma'am 
        had joined an art colony somewhere in Europe, and Miss was a poet in New 
        York. They wrote sometimes, but not often. Little Miss was married and 
        lived not far away. She said she did not want to leave Andrew. When her 
        child, Little Sir, was born, she let Andrew hold the bottle and feed him.<br>
        With the birth of a grandson, Andrew felt that Sir finally had someone 
        to replace those who had gone. Therefore, it would not be so unfair now 
        to come to him with the request.<br>
        &quot;Sir, it is kind of you to have allowed me to spend my money as I 
        wished&quot;<br>
        &quot;It was your money, Andrew.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Only by your voluntary act, Sir. I do not believe the law would 
        have stopped you from keeping it all.&quot;<br>
        &quot;The law won't persuade me to do wrong, Andrew.&quot; <br>
        &quot;Despite all expenses, and despite taxes, too, Sir, I have nearly 
        six hundred thousand dollars.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I know that, Andrew.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I want to give it to you, Sir.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I won't take it, Andrew&quot;<br>
        &quot;In exchange for something you can give me, Sir&quot;<br>
        &quot;Oh? What is that, Andrew?&quot;<br>
        &quot;My freedom, Sir.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Your-&quot;<br>
        &quot;I wish to buy my freedom, Sir.&quot; </p>
      <p><br>
        6</p>
      <p> It wasn't that easy. Sir had flushed, had said, &quot;For God's sake!&quot; 
        Then he had turned on his heel and stalked away.<br>
        It was Little Miss who finally brought him round, defiantly and harshly- 
        and in front of Andrew. For thirty years no one had ever hesitated to 
        talk in front of Andrew, whether or not the matter involved Andrew. He 
        was only a robot.<br>
        &quot;Dad, why are you taking this as a personal affront? He'll still 
        be here. He'll still be loyal. He can't help that; it's built in. All 
        he wants is a form of words. Ha wants to be called free. Is that so terrible? 
        Hasn't be earned this chance? Heavens, he and I have been talking about 
        it for years!&quot;<br>
        &quot;Talking about it for years, have you?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Yes, and over and over again he postponed it for fear he would hurt 
        you. I made him put the matter up to you.&quot;<br>
        &quot;He doesn't know what freedom is. He's a robot.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Dad, you don't know him. He's read everything in the library. I 
        don't know what he feels inside, but I don't know what you feel inside 
        either. When you talk to him you'll find he reacts to the various abstractions 
        as you and I do, and what else counts? If some one else's reactions are 
        like your own, what more can you ask for?&quot;<br>
        &quot;The law won't take that attitude,&quot; Sir said, angrily. &quot;See 
        here, you!&quot; He turned to Andrew with a deliberate grate in his voice. 
        &quot;I can't free you except by doing it legally. If this gets into the 
        courts, you not only won't get your freedom but the law will take official 
        cognizance of your money. They'll tell you that a robot has no right to 
        earn money. Is this rigmarole worth losing your money?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Freedom is without price, Sir,&quot; said Andrew. &quot;Even the 
        chance of freedom is worth the money.&quot; </p>
      <p><br>
        7</p>
      <p> It seemed the court might also take the attitude that freedom was without 
        price, and might decide that for no price, however great, could a robot 
        buy its freedom.<br>
        The simple statement of the regional attorney who represented those who 
        had brought a class action to oppose the freedom was this: &quot;The word 
        `freedom' has no meaning when applied to a robot. Only a human being can 
        be free.&quot; He said it several times, when it seemed appropriate; slowly, 
        with his hand coming down rhythmically on the desk before him to mark 
        the words.<br>
        Little Miss asked permission to speak on behalf of Andrew.<br>
        She was recognized by her full name, something Andrew had never heard 
        pronounced before: &quot;Amanda Laura Martin Charney may approach the 
        bench.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Thank you, Your Honor. I am not a lawyer and I don't know the proper 
        way of phrasing things, but I hope you will listen to my meaning and ignore 
        the words.<br>
        &quot;Let's understand what it means to be free in Andrew's case. In some 
        ways, he is free. I think it's at least twenty years since anyone in the 
        Martin family gave him an order to do something that we felt he might 
        not do of his own accord. But we can, if we wish, give him an order to 
        do anything, couching it as harshly as we wish, because he is a machine 
        that belongs to us. Why should we be in a position to do so, when he has 
        served us so long, so faithfully, and has earned so much money for us? 
        He owes us nothing more. The debit is entirely on the other side.<br>
        &quot;Even if we were legally forbidden to place Andrew in involuntary 
        servitude, he would still serve us voluntarily. Making him free would 
        be a trick of words only, but it would mean much to him. It would give 
        him everything and cost us nothing.&quot;<br>
        For a moment the judge seemed to be suppressing a smile. &quot;I see your 
        point, Mrs. Chamey. The fact is that there is no binding law in this respect 
        and no precedent. There is, however, the unspoken assumption that only 
        a man may enjoy freedom. I can make new law here, subject to reversal 
        in a higher court; but I cannot lightly run counter to that assumption. 
        Let me address the robot. Andrew!&quot;<br>
        &quot;Yes, Your Honor.&quot;<br>
        It was the first time Andrew bad spoken in court, and the judge seemed 
        astonished for a moment at the human timbre of his voice.<br>
        &quot;Why do you want to be free, Andrew? In what way will this matter 
        to you?&quot;<br>
        Andrew said, &quot;Would you wish to be a slave, Your Honor?&quot;<br>
        &quot;But you are not a slave. You are a perfectly good robot- a genius 
        of a robot, I am given to understand, capable of an artistic expression 
        that can be matched nowhere. What more could you do if you were free?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Perhaps no more than I do now, Your Honor, but with greater joy. 
        It has been said in this courtroom that only a human being can be free. 
        It seems to me that only someone who wishes for freedom can be free. I 
        wish for freedom.&quot;<br>
        And it was that statement that cued the judge. The crucial sentence in 
        his decision was &quot;There is no right to deny freedom to any object 
        with a mind advanced enough to grasp the concept and desire the state.&quot; 
        It was eventually upheld by the World Court. </p>
      <p><br>
        8</p>
      <p> Sir remained displeased, and his harsh voice made Andrew feel as if 
        he were being short-circuited. &quot;I don't want your damned money, Andrew. 
        I'll take it only because you won't feel free otherwise. From now on, 
        you can select your own jobs and do them as you please. I will give you 
        no orders, except this one: Do as you please. But I am still responsible 
        for you. That's part of the court order. I hope you understand that.&quot;<br>
        Little Miss interrupted. &quot;Don't be irascible, Dad. The responsibility 
        is no great chore. You know you won't have to do a thing. The Three Laws 
        still hold.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Then how is he free?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Are not human beings bound by their laws, Sir?&quot; Andrew replied.<br>
        &quot;I'm not going to argue.&quot; Sir left the room, and Andrew saw 
        him only infrequently after that.<br>
        Little Miss came to see him frequently in the small house that had been 
        built and made over for him. It had no kitchen, of course, nor bathroom 
        facilities. It had just two rooms; one was a library and one was a combination 
        storeroom and workroom. Andrew accepted many commissions and worked harder 
        as a free robot than he ever had before, till the cost of the house was 
        paid for and the structure was signed over to him.<br>
        One day Little Sir- no, &quot;George!&quot;- came. Little Sir had insisted 
        on that after the court decision. &quot;A free robot doesn't call anyone 
        Little Sir,&quot; George had said. &quot;I call you Andrew. You must call 
        me George.&quot;<br>
        His preference was phrased as an order, so Andrew called him George- but 
        Little Miss remained Little Miss.<br>
        One day when George came alone, it was to say that Sir was dying. Little 
        Miss was at the bedside, but Sir wanted Andrew as well.<br>
        Sir's voice was still quite strong, though he seemed unable to move much. 
        He struggled to raise his hand.<br>
        &quot;Andrew,&quot; he said, &quot;Andrew- Don't help me, George. I'm 
        only dying; I'm not crippled. Andrew, I'm glad you're free. I just wanted 
        to tell you that.&quot;<br>
        Andrew did not know what to say. He had never been at the side of someone 
        dying before, but he knew it was the human way of ceasing to function. 
        It was an involuntary and irreversible dismantling, and Andrew did not 
        know what to say that might be appropriate. He could only remain standing, 
        absolutely silent, absolutely motionless.<br>
        When it was over, Little Miss said to him, &quot;He may not have seemed 
        friendly to you toward the end, Andrew, but he was old, you know; and 
        it hurt him that you should want to be free.&quot;<br>
        Then Andrew found the words. &quot;I would never have been free without 
        him, Little Miss.&quot; </p>
      <p><br>
        9</p>
      <p> Only after Sir's death did Andrew begin to wear clothes. He began with 
        an old pair of trousers at first, a pair that George had given him.<br>
        George was married now, and a lawyer. He had joined Feingold's firm. Old 
        Feingold was long since dead, but his daughter had carried on. Eventually 
        the firm's name became Feingold and Martin. It remained so even when the 
        daughter retired and no Feingold took her place. At the time Andrew first 
        put on clothes, the Martin name had just been added to the firm.<br>
        George had tried not to smile the first time he saw Andrew attempting 
        to put on trousers, but to Andrew's eyes the smile was clearly there. 
        George showed Andrew how to manipulate the static charge to allow the 
        trousers to open, wrap about his lower body, and move shut. George demonstrated 
        on his own trousers, but Andrew was quite aware it would take him a while 
        to duplicate that one flowing motion.<br>
        &quot;But why do you want trousers, Andrew? Your body is so beautifully 
        functional it's a shame to cover it especially when you needn't worry 
        about either temperature control or modesty. And the material doesn't 
        cling properly- not on metal.&quot;<br>
        Andrew held his ground. &quot;Are not human bodies beautifully functional, 
        George? Yet you cover yourselves.&quot;<br>
        &quot;For warmth, for cleanliness, for protection, for decorativeness. 
        None of that applies to you.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I feel bare without clothes. I feel different, George,&quot; Andrew 
        responded.<br>
        &quot;Different! Andrew, there are millions of robots on Earth now. In 
        this region, according to the last census, there are almost as many robots 
        as there are men.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I know, George. There are robots doing every conceivable type of 
        work.&quot;<br>
        &quot;And none of them wear clothes.&quot;<br>
        &quot;But none of them are free, George.&quot;<br>
        Little by little, Andrew added to his wardrobe. He was inhibited by George's 
        smile and by the stares of the people who commissioned work.<br>
        He might be free, but there was built into Andrew a carefully detailed 
        program concerning his behavior to people, and it was only by the tiniest 
        steps that he dared advance; open disapproval would set him back months. 
        Not everyone accepted Andrew as free. He was incapable of resenting that, 
        and yet there was a difficulty about his thinking process when he thought 
        of it. Most of all, he tended to avoid putting on clothes- or too many 
        of them- when he thought Little Miss might come to visit him. She was 
        older now and was often away in some warmer climate, but when she returned 
        the first thing she did was visit him.<br>
        On one of her visits, George said, ruefully, &quot;She's got me, Andrew. 
        I'll be running for the legislature next year. `Like grandfather,' she 
        says, `like grandson.'&quot;<br>
        &quot;Like grandfather . . .&quot; Andrew stopped, uncertain.<br>
        &quot;I mean that I, George, the grandson, will be like Sir, the grandfather, 
        who was in the legislature once.&quot;<br>
        &quot;It would be pleasant, George, if Sir were still-&quot; He paused, 
        for he did not want to say, &quot;in working order.&quot; That seemed 
        inappropriate.<br>
        &quot;Alive;&quot; George said. &quot;Yes, I think of the old monster 
        now and then, too.&quot;<br>
        Andrew often thought about this conversation. He had noticed his own incapacity 
        in speech when talking with George. Somehow the language had changed since 
        Andrew had come into being with a built-in vocabulary. Then, too, George 
        used a colloquial speech, as Sir and Little Miss had not. Why should he 
        have called Sir a monster when surely that word was not a appropriate. 
        Andrew could not even turn to his own books for guidance. They were old, 
        and most dealt with woodworking, with art, with furniture design. There 
        were none on language, none on the ways of human beings.<br>
        Finally, it seemed to him that he must seek the proper books; and as a 
        free robot, he felt he must not ask George. He would go to town and use 
        the library. It was a triumphant decision and he felt his electro potential 
        grow distinctly higher until he had to throw in an impedance coil.<br>
        He put on a full costume, including even a shoulder chain of wood. He 
        would have preferred the glitter plastic, but George had said that wood 
        was much more appropriate, and that polished cedar was considerably more 
        valuable as well.<br>
        He had placed a hundred feet between himself and the house before gathering 
        resistance brought him to a halt. He shifted the impedance coil out of 
        circuit, and when that did not seem to help enough he returned to his 
        home and on a piece of notepaper wrote neatly, &quot;I have gone to the 
        library,&quot; and placed it in clear view on his worktable. </p>
      <p><br>
        10</p>
      <p> Andrew never quite got to the library.<br>
        He had studied the map. He knew the route, but not the appearance of it. 
        The actual landmarks did not resemble the symbols on the map and he would 
        hesitate. Eventually, he thought he must have somehow gone wrong, for 
        everything looked strange.<br>
        He passed an occasional field-robot, but by the time he decided he should 
        ask his way none were in sight. A vehicle passed and did not stop.<br>
        Andrew stood irresolute, which meant calmly motionless, for coming across 
        the field toward him were two human beings.<br>
        He turned to face them, and they altered their course to meet him. A moment 
        before, they had been talking loudly. He had heard their voices. But now 
        they were silent. They had the look that Andrew associated with human 
        uncertainty; and they were young, but not very young. Twenty, perhaps? 
        Andrew could never judge human age.<br>
        &quot;Would you describe to me the route to the town library, sirs?&quot;<br>
        One of them, the taller of the two, whose tall hat lengthened him still 
        farther, almost grotesquely, said, not to Andrew, but to the other, &quot;It's 
        a robot.&quot;<br>
        The other had a bulbous nose and heavy eyelids. He said, not to Andrew 
        but to the first, &quot;It's wearing clothes.&quot;<br>
        The tall one snapped his fingers. &quot;It's the free robot. They have 
        a robot at the old Martin place who isn't owned by anybody. Why else would 
        it be wearing clothes?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Ask it,&quot; said the one with the nose.<br>
        &quot;Are you the Martin robot?&quot; asked the tall one.<br>
        &quot;I am Andrew Martin, sir,&quot; Andrew said.<br>
        &quot;Good. Take off your clothes. Robots don't wear clothes.&quot; He 
        said to the other, &quot;That's disgusting. Look at him!&quot;<br>
        Andrew hesitated. He hadn't heard an order in that tone of voice in so 
        long that his Second Law circuits had momentarily jammed.<br>
        The tall one repeated, &quot;Take off your clothes. I order you.&quot;<br>
        Slowly, Andrew began to remove them.<br>
        &quot;Just drop them,&quot; said the tall one.<br>
        The nose said, &quot;If it doesn't belong to anyone, it could be ours 
        as much as someone else's.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Anyway,&quot; said the tall one, &quot;who's to object to anything 
        we do. We're not damaging property.&quot; tie turned to Andrew. &quot;Stand 
        on your head.&quot; &quot;The head is not meant-&quot; Andrew began.<br>
        &quot;That's an order. If you don't know how, try anyway.&quot;<br>
        Andrew hesitated again, then bent to put his head on the ground. He tried 
        to lift his legs but fell, heavily.<br>
        The tall one said, &quot;Just lie there.&quot; He said to the other, &quot;We 
        can take him apart. Ever take a robot apart?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Will he let us?&quot;<br>
        &quot;How can he stop us?&quot;<br>
        There was no way Andrew could stop them, if they ordered him in a forceful 
        enough manner not to resist The Second Law of obedience took precedence 
        over the Third Law of self-preservation. In any case, he could not defend 
        himself without possibly hurting them, and that would mean breaking the 
        First Law. At that thought, he felt every motile unit contract slightly 
        and he quivered as he lay there.<br>
        The tall one walked over and pushed at him with his foot. &quot;He's heavy. 
        I think we'll need tools to do the job.&quot;<br>
        The nose said, &quot;We could order him to take himself, apart. It would 
        be fun to watch him try.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Yes,&quot; said the tall one, thoughtfully, &quot;but let's get 
        him off the road. If someone comes along-&quot;<br>
        It was too late. Someone had, indeed, come along and it was George. From 
        where he lay, Andrew had seen him topping a small rise in the middle distance. 
        He would have liked to signal him in some way, but the last order had 
        been &quot;Just lie there!&quot;<br>
        George was running now, and he arrived on the scene somewhat winded. The 
        two young men stepped back a little and then waited thoughtfully.<br>
        &quot;Andrew, has something gone wrong?&quot; George asked, anxiously.<br>
        Andrew replied, &quot;I am well, George.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Then stand up. What happened to your clothes?&quot;<br>
        &quot;That your robot, Mac?&quot; the tall young man asked.<br>
        George turned sharply. &quot;He's no one's robot. What's been going on 
        here.&quot;<br>
        &quot;We politely asked him to take his clothes off. What's that to you, 
        if you don't own him.&quot;<br>
        George turned to Andrew. &quot;What were they doing, Andrew?&quot;<br>
        &quot;It was their intention in some way to dismember me. They were about 
        to move me to a quiet spot and order me to dismember myself.&quot;<br>
        George looked at the two young men, and his chin trembled.<br>
        The young men retreated no farther. They were smiling.<br>
        The tall one said, lightly, &quot;What are you going to do, pudgy? Attack 
        us?&quot;<br>
        George said, &quot;No. I don't have to. This robot has been with my family 
        for over seventy-five years. He knows us and he values us more than he 
        values anyone else. I am going to tell him that you two are threatening 
        my life and that you plan to kill me. I will ask him to defend me. In 
        choosing between me and you two, he will choose me. Do you know what will 
        happen to you when he attacks you?&quot;<br>
        The two were backing away slightly, looking uneasy.<br>
        George said, sharply, &quot;Andrew, I am in danger and about to come to 
        harm from these young men. Move toward them!&quot;<br>
        Andrew did so, and the young men did not wait. They ran.<br>
        &quot;All right, Andrew, relax,&quot; George said. He looked unstrung. 
        He was far past the age where he could face the possibility of a dustup 
        with one young man, let alone two.<br>
        &quot;I couldn't have hurt them, George: I could see they were not attacking 
        you.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I didn't order you to attack them. I only told you to move toward 
        them. Their own fears did the rest.&quot;<br>
        &quot;How can they fear robots?&quot;<br>
        &quot;It's a disease of mankind, one which has not yet been cured. But 
        never mind that. What the devil are you doing here, Andrew? Good thing 
        I found your note. I was just on the point of turning back and hiring 
        a helicopter when I found you. How did you get it into your head to go 
        to the library? I would have brought you any books you needed&quot;<br>
        &quot;I am a-&quot; Andrew began.<br>
        &quot;Free robot. Yes, yes. All right, what did you want in the library?&quot;<br>
        &quot;I want to know more about human beings, about the world, about everything. 
        And about robots, George. I want to write a history about robots.&quot;<br>
        George put his arm on the other's shoulder. &quot;Well, let's walk home. 
        But pick up your clothes first. Andrew, there are a million books on robotics 
        and all of them include histories of the science. The world is growing 
        saturated not only with robots but with information about robots.&quot;<br>
        Andrew shook his head, a human gesture he had lately begun to adopt. &quot;Not 
        a history of robotics, George. A history of robots, by a robot. I want 
        to explain how robots feel about what has happened since the first ones 
        were allowed to work and live on Earth.&quot;<br>
        George's eyebrows lifted, but he said nothing in direct response. </p>
      <p><br>
        11</p>
      <p> Little Miss was just past her eighty-third birthday, but there was nothing 
        about her that was lacking in either energy or determination. She gestured 
        with her cane oftener than she propped herself up with it.<br>
        She listened to the story in a fury of indignation. &quot;George, that's 
        horrible. Who were those young ruffians?&quot;<br>
        &quot;I don't know. What difference does it make? In the end they did 
        not do any damage.&quot;<br>
        &quot;They might have. You're a lawyer, George; and if you're well off, 
        it's entirely due to the talents of Andrew. It was the money he earned 
        that is the foundation of everything we have. He provides the continuity 
        for this family, and I will not have him treated as a wind-up toy.&quot;<br>
        &quot;What would you have me do, Mother?&quot; George asked.<br>
        &quot;I said you're a lawyer. Don't you listen? You set up a test case 
        somehow, and you force the regional courts to declare for robot rights 
        and get the legislature to pass the necessary bills. Carry the whole thing 
        to the World Court, if you have to. I'll be watching, George, and I'll 
        tolerate no shirking.&quot;<br>
        She was serious, so what began as a way of soothing the fearsome old lady 
        became an involved matter with enough legal entanglement to make it interesting. 
        As senior partner of Feingold and Martin, George plotted strategy. But 
        he left the actual work to his junior partners, with much of it a matter 
        for his son, Paul, who was also a member of the firm and who reported 
        dutifully nearly every day to his grandmother. She, in turn, discussed 
        the case every day with Andrew.<br>
        Andrew was deeply involved. His work on his book on robots was delayed 
        again, as he pored over the legal arguments and even, at times, made very 
        diffident suggestions. <br>
        &quot;George told me that day I was attacked that human beings have always 
        been afraid of robots,&quot; he said one day. &quot;As long as they are, 
        the courts and the legislatures are not likely to work hard on behalf 
        of robots. Should not something be done about public opinion?&quot;<br>
        So while Paul stayed in court, George took to the public platform. It 
        gave him the advantage of being informal, and he even went so far sometimes 
        as to wear the new, loose style of clothing which he called drapery.<br>
        Paul chided him, &quot;Just don't trip over it on stage, Dad.&quot;<br>
        George replied, despondently, &quot;I'll try not to.&quot;<br>
        He addressed the annual convention of holo-news editors on one occasion 
        and said, in part: &quot;If, by virtue of the Second Law, we can demand 
        of any robot unlimited obedience in all respects not involving harm to 
        a human being, then any human being, any human being, has a fearsome power 
        over any robot, any robot. In particular, since Second Law supersedes 
        Third Law; any human being can use the law of obedience to overcome the 
        law of self-protection. He can order any robot to damage itself or even 
        to destroy itself for any reason, or for no reason.<br>
        &quot;Is this just? Would we treat an animal so? Even an inanimate object 
        which had given us good service has a claim on our consideration. And 
        a robot is not insensitive; it is not an animal. It can think well enough 
        so that it can talk to us, reason with us, joke with us. Can we treat 
        them as friends, can we work together with them, and not give them some 
        of the fruits of that friendship, some of the benefits of co-working?<br>
        &quot;If a man has the right to give a robot any order that does not involve 
        harm to a human being, he should have the decency never to give a robot 
        any order that involves harm to a robot, unless human safety absolutely 
        requires it. With great power goes great responsibility, and if the robots 
        have Three Laws to protect men, is it too much to ask that men have a 
        law or two to protect robots?&quot;<br>
        Andrew was right. It was the battle over public opinion that held the 
        key to courts and legislature. In the end, a law was passed that set up 
        conditions under which robot-harming orders were forbidden. It was endlessly 
        qualified and the punishments for violating the law were totally inadequate, 
        but the principle was established. The final passage by the World Legislature 
        came through on the day of Little Miss' death.<br>
        That was no coincidence. Little Miss held on to life desperately during 
        the last debate and let go only when word of victory arrived. Her last 
        smile was for Andrew. Her last words were, &quot;You have been good to 
        us, Andrew.&quot; She died with her hand holding his, while her son and 
        his wife and children remained at a respectful distance from both. </p>
      <p><br>
        12</p>
      <p> Andrew waited patiently when the receptionist-robot disappeared into 
        the inner office. The receptionist might have used the holographic chatterbox, 
        but un-questionably it was perturbed by having to deal with another robot 
        rather than with a human being.<br>
        Andrew passed the time revolving the matter his mind: Could &quot;unroboted&quot; 
        be used as an analog of &quot;unmanned,&quot; or had unmanned become a 
        metaphoric term sufficiently divorced from its original literal meaning 
        to be applied to robots-or to women for that matter? Such problems frequently 
        arose as he worked on his book on robots. The trick of thinking out sentences 
        to express all complexities had undoubtedly increased his vocabulary.<br>
        Occasionally, someone came into the room to stare at him and he did not 
        try to avoid the glance. He looked at each calmly, and each in turn looked 
        away.<br>
        Paul Martin finally emerged. He looked surprised, or he would have if 
        Andrew could have made out his expression with certainty. Paul had taken 
        to wearing the heavy makeup that fashion was dictating for bath sexes. 
        Though it made sharper and firmer the somewhat bland lines of Paul's face, 
        Andrew disapproved. He found that disapproving of human beings, as long 
        as he did not express it verbally, did not make him very uneasy. He could 
        even write the disapproval. He was sure it had not always been so.<br>
        &quot;Come in, Andrew. I'm sorry I made you wait, but there was something 
        I had to finish. Come in, you had said you wanted to talk to me, but I 
        didn't know you meant here in town.&quot;<br>
        &quot;If you are busy, Paul, I am prepared to continue to wait.&quot;<br>
        Paul glanced at the interplay of shifting shadows on the dial on the wall 
        that served as timepieces and said, &quot;I can make some time. Did you 
        come alone?&quot;<br>
        &quot;I hired an automatobile.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Any trouble?&quot; Paul asked, with more than a trace of anxiety.<br>
        &quot;I wasn't expecting any. My rights are protected.&quot;<br>
        Paul looked all the more anxious for that. &quot;Andrew, I've explained 
        that the law is unenforceable, at least under most conditions. And if 
        you insist on wearing clothes, you'll run into trouble eventually; just 
        like that first time.&quot;<br>
        &quot;And only tine, Paul. I'm sorry you are displeased&quot;<br>
        &quot;Well, look at it this way: you are virtually a living legend, Andrew, 
        and you are too valuable in many different ways for you to have any right 
        to take chances with yourself. By the way, how's the book coming?&quot;<br>
        &quot;I am approaching the end, Paul. The publisher is quite pleased.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Good!&quot;<br>
        &quot;I don't know that he's necessarily pleased with the book as a book. 
        I think he expects to sell many copies because it's written by a robot 
        and that's what pleases him.<br>
        &quot;Only human, I'm afraid.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I am not displeased. Let it sell for whatever reason, since it will 
        mean money and I can use some.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Grandmother left you-&quot;<br>
        &quot;Little Miss was generous, and I'm sure I can count on the family 
        to help me out further. But it is the royalties from the book on which 
        I am counting to help me through the next step.&quot;<br>
        &quot;What next step is that?&quot;<br>
        &quot;I wish to see the head of U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men Corporation. 
        I have tried to make an appointment; but so far I have not been able to 
        reach him. The Corporation did not cooperate with me in the writing of 
        the book, so I am not surprised, you understand.&quot;<br>
        Paul was clearly amused. &quot;Cooperation is the last thing you can expect. 
        They didn't cooperate with us in our great fight for robot rights. Quite 
        the reverse, and you can see why. Give a robot rights and people may not 
        want to buy them.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Nevertheless,&quot; said Andrew, &quot;if you call them, you may 
        be able to obtain an interview for me.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I'm no more popular with them than you are, Andrew.&quot;<br>
        &quot;But perhaps you can hint that by seeing me they may head off a campaign 
        by Feingold and Martin to strengthen the rights of robots further.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Wouldn't that be a lie, Andrew?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Yes, Paul, and I can't tell one. That is why you must call.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Ah, you can't lie, but you can urge me to tell a lie, is that it? 
        You're getting more human all the time, Andrew.&quot; </p>
      <p><br>
        13</p>
      <p> The meeting was not easy to arrange, even with Paul's supposedly weighted 
        name.<br>
        But it finally came about. When it did, Harley Smythe-Robertson, who, 
        on his mother's side, was descended from the original founder of the corporation 
        and who had adopted the hyphenation to indicate it, looked remarkably 
        unhappy. He was approaching retirement age and his entire tenure as president 
        had been devoted to the matter of robot rights. His gray hair was plastered 
        thinly over the top of his scalp; his face was not made up, and he eyed 
        Andrew with brief hostility from time to time.<br>
        Andrew began the conversation. &quot;Sir, nearly a century ago, I was 
        told by a Merton Mansky of this corporation that the mathematics governing 
        the plotting of the positronic pathways was far too complicated to permit 
        of any but approximate solutions and that, therefore, my own capacities 
        were not fully predictable.&quot;<br>
        &quot;That was a century ago.&quot; Smythe-Robertson hesitated, then said 
        icily, &quot;Sir. It is true no longer. Our robots are made with precision 
        now and are trained precisely to their jobs.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Yes,&quot; said Paul, who had come along, as he said, to make sure 
        that the corporation played fair, &quot;with the result that my receptionist 
        must be guided at every point once events depart from the conventional, 
        however slightly.&quot;<br>
        &quot;You would be much more displeased if it were to improvise,&quot; 
        Smythe-Robertson said.<br>
        &quot;Then you no longer manufacture robots like myself which are flexible 
        and adaptable.&quot;<br>
        &quot;No longer.&quot;<br>
        &quot;The research I have done in connection with my book,&quot; said 
        Andrew, &quot;indicates that I am the oldest robot presently in active 
        operation.&quot;<br>
        &quot;The oldest presently,&quot; said Smythe-Robertson, &quot;and the 
        oldest ever. The oldest that will ever be. No robot is useful after the 
        twenty-fifth year. They are called in and replaced with newer models.&quot;<br>
        &quot;No robot as presently manufactured is useful after the twentieth 
        year,&quot; said Paul, with a note of sarcasm creeping into his voice. 
        &quot;Andrew is quite exceptional in this respect.&quot;<br>
        Andrew, adhering to the path he had marked out for himself, continued, 
        &quot;As the oldest robot in the world and the most flexible, am I not 
        unusual enough to merit special treatment from the company?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Not at all,&quot; Smythe-Robertson said, freezing up. &quot;Your 
        unusualness is an embarrassment to the company. If you were on lease, 
        instead of having been an outright sale through some mischance, you would 
        long since have been replaced.&quot;<br>
        &quot;But that is exactly the point,&quot; said Andrew. &quot;I am a free 
        robot and I own myself. Therefore I come to you and ask you to replace 
        me. You cannot do this without the owner's consent. Nowadays, that consent 
        is extorted as a condition of the lease, but in my time this did not happen.&quot;<br>
        Smythe-Robertson was looking both startled and puzzled, and for a moment 
        there was silence. Andrew found himself staring at the hologram on the 
        wall. It was a death mask of Susan Calvin, patron saint of all roboticists. 
        She had been dead for nearly two centuries now, but as a result of writing 
        his book Andrew knew, her so well he could half persuade himself that 
        he had met her in life.<br>
        Finally Smythe-Robertson asked, &quot;How can I replace you for you? If 
        I replace you, as robot, how can I donate the new robot to you as owner 
        since in the very act of replacement you cease to exist.&quot; He smiled 
        grimly.<br>
        &quot;Not at all difficult,&quot; Paul interposed. &quot;The seat of Andrew's 
        personality is his positronic brain and it is the one part that cannot 
        be replaced without creating a new robot. The positronic brain, therefore, 
        is Andrew the owner. Every other part of the robotic body can be replaced 
        without affecting the robot's personality, and those other parts are the 
        brain's possessions. Andrew, I should say, wants to supply his brain with 
        a new robotic body.&quot;<br>
        &quot;That's right,&quot; said Andrew, calmly. He turned to Smythe-Robertson. 
        &quot;You have manufactured androids, haven't you? Robots that have the 
        outward appearance of humans, complete to the texture of the skin?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Yes, we have. They worked perfectly well, with their synthetic fibrous 
        skins and tendons. There was virtually no metal anywhere except for the 
        brain, yet they were nearly as tough as metal robots. They were tougher, 
        weight for weight.&quot;<br>
        Paul looked interested. &quot;I didn't know that. How many are on the 
        market?&quot;<br>
        &quot;None,&quot; said Smythe-Robertson. &quot;They were much more expensive 
        than metal models and a market survey showed they would not be accepted. 
        They looked too human.&quot;<br>
        Andrew was impressed. &quot;But the corporation retains its expertise, 
        I assume. Since it does, I wish to request that I be replaced by an organic 
        robot, an android.&quot;<br>
        Paul looked surprised. &quot;Good Lord!&quot; he said.<br>
        Smythe-Robertson stiffened. &quot;Quite impossible!&quot;<br>
        &quot;Why is it impossible?&quot; Andrew asked. &quot;I will pay any reasonable 
        fee, of course.&quot;<br>
        &quot;We do not manufacture androids.&quot;<br>
        &quot;You do not choose to manufacture androids,&quot; Paul interjected 
        quickly. &quot;That is not the same as being unable to manufacture them.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Nevertheless,&quot; Smythe-Robertson responded, &quot;the manufacture 
        of androids is against public policy.&quot;<br>
        &quot;There is no law against it,&quot; said Paul.<br>
        &quot;Nevertheless, we do not manufacture them- and we will not.&quot;<br>
        Paul cleared his throat. &quot;Mr. Smythe-Robertson,&quot; he said, &quot;Andrew 
        is a free robot who comes under the purview of the law guaranteeing robot 
        rights. You are aware of this, I take it?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Only too well.&quot;<br>
        &quot;This robot, as a free robot, chooses to wear clothes. This results 
        in his being frequently humiliated by thoughtless human beings despite 
        the law against the humiliation of robots. It is difficult to prosecute 
        vague offenses that don't meet with the general disapproval of those who 
        must decide on guilt and innocence.&quot;<br>
        &quot;U.S. Robots understood that from the start. Your father's firm unfortunately 
        did not.&quot;<br>
        &quot;My father is dead now, but what I see is that we have here a clear 
        offense with a clear target.&quot;<br>
        &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; said Smythe-Robertson.<br>
        &quot;My client, Andrew Martin- he has just become my client- is a free 
        robot who is entitled to ask U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men Corporation 
        for the rights of replacement, which the corporation supplies to anyone 
        who owns a robot for more than twenty-five years. In fact, the corporation 
        insists on such replacement.&quot;<br>
        Paul was smiling and thoroughly at ease. &quot;The positronic brain of 
        my client,&quot; he went on, &quot;is the owner of the body of my client 
        which is certainly more than twenty-five years old. The positronic brain 
        demands the replacement of the body and offers to pay any reasonable fee 
        for an android body as that replacement. If you refuse the request, my 
        client undergoes humiliation and we will sue.<br>
        &quot;While public opinion would not ordinarily support the claim of a 
        robot in such a case, may I remind you that U.S. Robots is not popular 
        with the public generally. Even those who most use and profit from robots 
        are suspicious of the corporation. This may be a hangover from the days 
        when robots were widely feared. It may be resentment against the power 
        and wealth of U.S. Robots, which has a worldwide monopoly. Whatever the 
        cause may be, the resentment eats. I think you will find that you would 
        prefer not to be faced with a lawsuit, particularly since my client is 
        wealthy and will live for many more centuries and will have no reason 
        to refrain from fighting the battle forever.&quot;<br>
        Smythe-Robertson had slowly reddened. &quot;You are trying to force-&quot;<br>
        &quot;I force you to do nothing,&quot; said Paul. &quot;If you wish to 
        refuse to accede to my client's reasonable request, you may by all means 
        do so and we will leave without another word. But we will sue, as is certainly 
        our right, and you will find that you will eventually lose.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Well.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I see that you are going to accede,&quot; said Paul. &quot;You may 
        hesitate but you will come to it in the end. Let me assure you, then, 
        of one further point: If, in the process of transferring my client's positronic 
        brain from his present body to an organic one, there is any damage, however 
        slight, then I will never rest until I've nailed the corporation to the 
        ground. I will, if necessary, take every possible step to mobilize public 
        opinion against the corporation if one brain path of my client's platinum-iridium 
        essence is scrambled.&quot; He turned to Andrew and asked, &quot;Do you 
        agree to all this, Andrew?&quot;<br>
        Andrew hesitated a full minute. It amounted to the approval of lying, 
        of blackmail, of the badgering and humiliation of a human being. But not 
        physical harm, he told himself, not physical harm.<br>
        He managed at last to come out with a rather faint &quot;Yes.&quot; </p>
      <p><br>
        14</p>
      <p> He felt as though he were being constructed again. For days, then for 
        weeks, finally for months, Andrew found himself not himself somehow, and 
        the simplest actions kept giving rise to hesitation.<br>
        Paul was frantic. &quot;They've damaged you, Andrew. We'll have to institute 
        suit!&quot;<br>
        Andrew spoke very slowly. &quot;You- mustn't. You'll never be able to 
        prove- something- like m-m-m-m- &quot;<br>
        &quot;Malice?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Malice. Besides, I grow- stronger, better. It's the tr- tr- tr- 
        &quot;<br>
        &quot;Tremble?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Trauma. After all, there's never been such an op-op-op- before.&quot;<br>
        Andrew could feel his brain from the inside. No one else could. He knew 
        he was well, and during the months that it took him to learn full coordination 
        and full positronic interplay he spent hours before the mirror.<br>
        Not quite human! The face was stiff- too stiff and the motions were too 
        deliberate. They lacked the careless, free flow of the human being, but 
        perhaps that might come with time. At least now he could wear clothes 
        without the ridiculous anomaly of a metal face going along with it.<br>
        Eventually, he said, &quot;I will be going back to work.&quot;<br>
        Paul laughed. &quot;That means you are well. What will you be doing? Another 
        book?&quot;<br>
        &quot;No,&quot; said Andrew, seriously. &quot;I live too long for any 
        one career to seize me by the throat and never let me go. There was a 
        time when I was primarily an artist, and I can still turn to that. And 
        there was a time when I was a historian, and I can still turn to that. 
        But now I wish to be a robobiologist.&quot;<br>
        &quot;A robopsychologist, you mean.&quot;<br>
        &quot;No. That would imply the study of positronic brains, and at the 
        moment I lack the desire to do that. A robobiologist, it seems to me, 
        would be concerned with the working of the body attached to that brain.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Wouldn't that be a roboticist?&quot;<br>
        &quot;A roboticist works with a metal body. I would be studying an organic 
        humanoid body, of which I have the only one, as far as I know.&quot;<br>
        &quot;You narrow your field,&quot; said Paul, thoughtfully. &quot;As an 
        artist, all conception is yours; as a historian you deal chiefly with 
        robots; as a robobiologist, you will deal with yourself.&quot;<br>
        Andrew nodded. &quot;It would seem so.&quot;<br>
        Andrew had to start from the very beginning, for he knew nothing of ordinary 
        biology and almost nothing of science. He became a familiar sight in the 
        libraries, where he sat at the electronic indices for hours at a time, 
        looking perfectly normal in clothes. Those few who knew he was a robot 
        in no way interfered with him.<br>
        He built a laboratory in a room which he added to his house; and his library 
        grew, too.<br>
        Years passed, and Paul came to him one day and said, &quot;It's a pity 
        you're no longer working on the history of robots. I understand U.S. Robots 
        is adopting a radically new policy.&quot;<br>
        Paul had aged, and his deteriorating eyes had been replaced with photoptic 
        cells. In that respect, he had drawn closer to Andrew.<br>
        &quot;What have they done?&quot; Andrew asked.<br>
        &quot;They are manufacturing central computers, gigantic positronic brains, 
        really, which communicate with anywhere from a dozen to a thousand robots 
        by microwave. The robots themselves have no brains at all. They are the 
        limbs of the gigantic brain, and the two are physically separate.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Is that more efficient?&quot;<br>
        &quot;U.S. Robots claims it is. Smythe-Robertson established the new direction 
        before he died, however, and it's my notion that it's a backlash at you. 
        U.S. Robots is determined that they will make no robots that will give 
        them the type of trouble you have, and for that reason they separate brain 
        and body. The brain will have no body to wish changed; the body will have 
        no brain to wish anything.<br>
        &quot;It's amazing, Andrew,&quot; Paul went on, &quot;the influence you 
        have had on the history of. robots. It was your artistry that encouraged 
        U.S. Robots to make robots more precise and specialized; it was your freedom 
        that resulted in the establishment of the principle of robotic rights; 
        it was your insistence on an android body that made U.S. Robots switch 
        to brain-body separation&quot;<br>
        Andrew grew thoughtful. &quot;I suppose in the end the corporation will 
        produce one vast brain controlling several billion robotic bodies. All 
        the eggs will be in one basket. Dangerous. Not proper at all.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I think you're right,&quot; said Paul, &quot;but I don't suspect 
        it will come to pass for a century at least and I won't live to see it. 
        In fact, I may not live to see next year.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Paul!&quot; cried Andrew, in concern.<br>
        Paul shrugged. &quot;Men are mortal, Andrew. We're not like you. It doesn't 
        matter too much, but it does make it important to assure you on one point. 
        I'm the last of the human Martins. The money I control personally will 
        be left to the trust in your name, and as far as anyone can foresee the 
        future, you will be economically secure.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Unnecessary,&quot; Andrew said, with difficulty. In all this time, 
        he could not get used to the deaths of the Martins.<br>
        &quot;Let's not argue. That's the way it's going to be. Now, what are 
        you working on?&quot;<br>
        &quot;I am designing a system for allowing androids- myself- to gain energy 
        from the combustion of hydrocarbons, rather than from atomic cells.&quot;<br>
        Paul raised his eyebrows. &quot;So that they will breathe and eat?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
        &quot;How long have you been pushing in that direction?&quot;<br>
        &quot;For a long time now, but I think I have finally designed an adequate 
        combustion chamber for catalyzed controlled breakdown.&quot;<br>
        &quot;But why, Andrew? The atomic cell is surely infinitely better.&quot; 
        <br>
        &quot;In some ways, perhaps. But the atomic cell is inhuman.&quot; </p>
      <p><br>
        15</p>
      <p> It took time, but Andrew had time. In the first place, he did not wish 
        to do anything till Paul had died in peace. With the death of the great-grandson 
        of Sir, Andrew felt more nearly exposed to a hostile world and for that 
        reason was all the more determined along the path he had chosen.<br>
        Yet he was not really alone. If a man had died, the firm of Feingold and 
        Martin lived, for a corporation does not die any more than a robot does.<br>
        The firm had its directions and it followed them soullessly. By way of 
        the trust and through the law firm, Andrew continued to be wealthy. In 
        return for their own large annual retainer, Feingold and Martin involved 
        themselves in the legal aspects of the new combustion chamber. But when 
        the time came for Andrew to visit U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men Corporation, 
        he did it alone. Once he had gone with Sir and once with Paul. This time, 
        the third time, he was alone and manlike.<br>
        U.S. Robots had changed. The actual production plant had been shifted 
        to a large space station, as had grown to be the case with more and more 
        industries. With them had gone many robots. The Earth itself was becoming 
        park like, with its one-billion-person population stabilized and perhaps 
        not more than thirty percent of its at-least-equally-large robot population 
        independently brained.<br>
        The Director of Research was Alvin Magdescu, dark of complexion and hair, 
        with a little pointed beard and wearing nothing above the waist but the 
        breast band that fashion dictated. Andrew himself was well covered in 
        the older fashion of several decades back.<br>
        Magdescu offered his hand to his visitor. &quot;I know you, of course, 
        and I'm rather pleased to see you. You're our most notorious product and 
        it's a pity old Smythe-Robertson was so set against you. We could have 
        done a great deal with you.&quot;<br>
        &quot;You still can,&quot; said Andrew.<br>
        &quot;No, I don't think so. We're past the time. We've had robots on Earth 
        for over a century, but that's changing. It will be back to space with 
        them, and those that stay here won't be brained.&quot;<br>
        &quot;But there remains myself, and I stay on Earth.&quot;<br>
        &quot;True, but there doesn't seem to be much of the robot about you. 
        What new request have you?&quot;<br>
        &quot;To be still less a robot. Since I am so far organic, I wish an organic 
        source of energy. I have here the plans-&quot;<br>
        Magdescu did not hasten through them. He might have intended to at first, 
        but he stiffened and grew intent. At one point, he said, &quot;This is 
        remarkably ingenious. Who thought of all this?&quot;<br>
        &quot;I did,&quot; Andrew replied.<br>
        Magdescu looked up at him sharply, then said, &quot;It would amount to 
        a major overhaul of your body, and an experimental one, since such a thing 
        has never been attempted before. I advise against it. Remain as you are.&quot;<br>
        Andrew's face had limited means of expression, but impatience showed plainly 
        in his voice. &quot;Dr. Magdescu, you miss the entire point: You have 
        no choice but to accede to my request. If such devices can be built into 
        my body, they can be built into human bodies as well. The tendency to 
        lengthen human life by prosthetic devices has already been remarked on. 
        There are no devices better than the ones I have designed or am designing. 
        As it happens, I control the patents by way of the firm of Feingold and 
        Martin. We are quite capable of going into business for ourselves and 
        of developing the kind of prosthetic devices that may end by producing 
        human beings with many of the properties of robots. Your own business 
        will then suffer.<br>
        &quot;If, however, you operate on me now and agree to do so under similar 
        circumstances in the future, you will receive permission to make use of 
        the patents and control the technology of both robots and of the prosthetization 
        of human beings. The initial leasing will not be granted, of course, until 
        after the first operation is completed successfully, and after enough 
        time has passed to demonstrate that it is indeed successful.&quot;<br>
        Andrew felt scarcely any First Law inhibition to the stern conditions 
        he was setting a human being. He was learning to reason that what seemed 
        like cruelty might, in the long run, be kindness.<br>
        Magdescu was stunned. &quot;I'm not the one to decide something like this. 
        That's a corporate decision that would take time.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I can wait a reasonable time,&quot; said Andrew, &quot;but only 
        a reasonable time.&quot; And he thought with satisfaction that Paul himself 
        could not have done it better. </p>
      <p><br>
        16</p>
      <p> It took only a reasonable time, and the operation was a success.<br>
        &quot;I was very much against the operation, Andrew,&quot; Magdescu said, 
        &quot;but not for the reasons you might think. I was not in the least 
        against the experiment, if it had been on someone else. I hated risking 
        your positronic brain. Now that you have the positronic pathways interacting 
        with simulated nerve pathways, it might have been difficult to rescue 
        the brain intact if the body had gone bad.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I had every faith in the skill of the staff at U.S. Robots,&quot; 
        said Andrew. &quot;And I can eat now.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Well, you can sip olive oil. It will mean occasional cleanings of 
        the combustion chamber, as we have explained to you. Rather an uncomfortable 
        touch, I should think.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Perhaps, if I did not expect to go further. Self cleaning is not 
        impossible. In fact, I am working on a device that will deal with solid 
        food that may be expected to contain incombustible fractions- indigestible 
        matter, so to speak, that will have to be discarded.&quot;<br>
        &quot;You would then have to develop an anus.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Or the equivalent.&quot;<br>
        &quot;What else, Andrew-?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Everything else.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Genitalia, too?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Insofar as they will fit my plans. My body is a canvas on which 
        I intend to draw-&quot;<br>
        Magdescu waited for the sentence to he completed, and when it seemed that 
        it would not be, he completed it himself. &quot;A man?&quot;<br>
        &quot;We shall see,&quot; Andrew said.<br>
        &quot;That's a puny ambition, Andrew. You're better than a man. You've 
        gone downhill from the moment you opted to become organic.&quot;<br>
        &quot;My brain has not suffered.&quot;<br>
        &quot;No, it hasn't. I'll grant you that. But, Andrew, the whole new breakthrough 
        in prosthetic devices made possible by your patents is being marketed 
        under your name. You're recognized as the inventor and you're being honored 
        for it- as you should be. Why play further games with your body?&quot;<br>
        Andrew did not answer.<br>
        The honors came. He accepted membership in several learned societies, 
        including one that was devoted to the new science he had established- 
        the one he had called robobiology but which had come to be termed prosthetology. 
        On the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of his construction, a testimonial 
        dinner was given in his honor at U.S. Robots. If Andrew saw an irony in 
        this, he kept it to himself.<br>
        Alvin Magdescu came out of retirement to chair the dinner. He was himself 
        ninety-four years old and was alive because he, too, had prosthetized 
        devices that, among other things, fulfilled the function of liver and 
        kidneys. The dinner reached its climax when Magdescu, after a short and 
        emotional talk, raised his glass to toast The Sesquicentennial Robot.<br>
        Andrew had had the sinews of his face redesigned to the point where he 
        could show a human range of emotions, but he sat through all the ceremonies 
        solemnly passive. He did not like to be a Sesquicentennial Robot. </p>
      <p><br>
        17</p>
      <p> It was prosthetology that finally took Andrew off the Earth.<br>
        In the decades that followed the celebration of his sesquicentennial, 
        the Moon had come to be a world more Earthlike than Earth in every respect 
        but its gravitational pull; and in its underground cities there was a 
        fairly dense population. Prosthetized devices there had to take the lesser 
        gravity into account. Andrew spent five years on the Moon working with 
        local prosthetologists to make the necessary adaptations. When not at 
        his work, he wandered among the robot population, every one of which treated 
        him with the robotic obsequiousness due a man.<br>
        He came back to an Earth that was humdrum and quiet in comparison, and 
        visited the offices of Feingold and Martin to announce his return.<br>
        The current head of the firm, Simon DeLong, was surprised. &quot;We had 
        been told you were returning, Andrew&quot;- he had almost said Mr. Martin- 
        &quot;but we were not expecting you till next week.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I grew impatient,&quot; said Andrew briskly. He was anxious to get 
        to the point. &quot;On the Moon, Simon, I was in charge of a research 
        team of twenty human scientists. I gave orders that no one questioned. 
        The Lunar robots deferred to me as they would to a human being. Why, then, 
        am I not a human being?&quot;<br>
        A wary look entered DeLong's eyes. &quot;My dear Andrew, as you have just 
        explained, you are treated as a human being by both robots and human beings. 
        You are, therefore, a human being de facto.&quot;<br>
        &quot;To be a human being de facto is not enough. I want not only to be 
        treated as one, but to be legally identified as one. I want to be a human 
        being de jure.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Now, that is another matter,&quot; DeLong said. &quot;There we would 
        run into human prejudice and into the undoubted fact that, however much 
        you may be like a human being, you are not a human being.&quot;<br>
        &quot;In what way not?&quot; Andrew asked. &quot;I have the shape of a 
        human being and organs equivalent to those of a human being. My organs, 
        in fact, are identical to some of those in a prosthetized human being. 
        I have contributed artistically, literally, and scientifically to human 
        culture as much as any human being now alive. What more can one ask?&quot;<br>
        &quot;I myself would ask nothing more. The trouble is that it would take 
        an act of the World Legislature to define you as a human being. Frankly, 
        I wouldn't expect that to happen.&quot;<br>
        &quot;To whom on the Legislature could I speak?&quot;<br>
        &quot;To the Chairman of the Science and Technology Committee, perhaps.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Can you arrange a meeting?&quot;<br>
        &quot;But you scarcely need an intermediary. In your position, you can-&quot;<br>
        &quot;No. You arrange it.&quot; It didn't even occur to Andrew that he 
        was giving a fiat order to a human being. He had grown so accustomed to 
        that on the Moon. &quot;I want him to know that the firm of Feingold and 
        Martin is backing me in this to the hilt.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Well, now-&quot;<br>
        &quot;To the hilt, Simon. In one hundred and seventy-three years I have 
        in one fashion or another contributed greatly to this firm. I have been 
        under obligation to individual members of the firm in times past. I am 
        not, now. It is rather the other way around now and I am calling in my 
        debts.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I will- do what I can,&quot; DeLong said. </p>
      <p><br>
        18</p>
      <p> The Chairman of the Science and Technology Committee was from the East 
        Asian region and was a woman. Her name was Chee Li-hsing and her transparent 
        garments- obscuring what she wanted obscured only by their dazzle- made 
        her look plastic-wrapped. &quot;I sympathize with your wish for full human 
        rights,&quot; she said. &quot;There have been times in history when segments 
        of the human population fought for full human rights. What rights, however, 
        can you possibly want that you do not have?&quot;<br>
        &quot;As simple a thing as my right to life,&quot; Andrew stated. &quot;A 
        robot can be dismantled at any time.&quot;<br>
        &quot;A human being can be executed at any time.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Execution can only follow due process of law. There is no trial 
        needed for my dismantling. Only the word of a human being in authority 
        is needed to end me. Besides- besides-&quot; Andrew tried desperately 
        to allow no sign of pleading, but his carefully designed tricks of human 
        expression and tone of voice betrayed him here. &quot;The truth is I want 
        to be a man. I have wanted it through six generations of human beings.&quot;<br>
        Li-hsing looked up at him out of darkly sympathetic eyes. &quot;The Legislature 
        can pass a law declaring you one. They could pass a law declaring that 
        a stone statue be defined as a man. Whether they will actually do so is, 
        however, as likely in the first case as the second. Congress people are 
        as human as the rest of the population and there is always that element 
        of suspicion against robots.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Even now?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Even now. We would all allow the fact that you have earned the prize 
        of humanity, and yet there would remain the fear of setting an undesirable 
        precedent.&quot;<br>
        &quot;What precedent? I am the only free robot, the only one of my type, 
        and there will never be another. You may consult U.S. Robots.&quot;<br>
        &quot;`Never' is a long word, Andrew- or, if you prefer, Mr. Martin- since 
        I will gladly give you my personal accolade as man. You will find that 
        most congress people will not be so willing to set the precedent, no matter 
        how meaningless such a precedent might be. Mr. Martin, you have my sympathy, 
        but I cannot tell you to hope. Indeed-&quot;<br>
        She sat back and her forehead wrinkled. &quot;Indeed, if the issue grows 
        too heated, there might well arise a certain sentiment, both inside the 
        Legislature and out side, for that dismantling you mentioned. Doing away 
        with you could turn out to be the easiest way of resolving the dilemma. 
        Consider that before deciding to push matters.&quot;<br>
        Andrew stood firm. &quot;Will no one remember the technique of prosthetology, 
        something that is almost entirely mine?&quot;<br>
        &quot;It may seem cruel, but they won't. Or if they do, it will be remembered 
        against you. People will say you did it only for yourself. It will be 
        said it was part of a campaign to roboticize human beings, or to humanify 
        robots; and in either case evil and vicious. You have never been part 
        of a political hate campaign, Mr. Martin; but I tell you that you would 
        be the object of vilification of a kind neither you nor I would credit, 
        and there would be people to believe it all. Mr. Martin, let your life 
        be.&quot;<br>
        She rose, and next to Andrew's seated figure she seemed small and almost 
        childlike.<br>
        &quot;If I decide to fight for my humanity, will you be on my side?&quot;<br>
        She thought, then replied, &quot;I will be- insofar as I can be. If at 
        any time such a stand would appear to threaten my political future, I 
        might have to abandon you, since it is not an issue I feel to be at the 
        very root of my beliefs. I am trying to be honest with you.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Thank you, and I will ask no more. I intend to fight this through, 
        whatever the consequences, and I will ask you for your help only for as 
        long as you can give it.&quot; </p>
      <p><br>
        19</p>
      <p> It was not a direct fight. Feingold and Martin counseled patience and 
        Andrew muttered, grimly, that he had an endless supply of that. Feingold 
        and Martin then entered on a campaign to narrow and restrict the area 
        of combat.<br>
        They instituted a lawsuit denying the obligation to pay debts to an individual 
        with a prosthetic heart on the grounds that the possession of a robotic 
        organ removed humanity, and with it the constitutional rights of human 
        beings. They fought the matter skillfully and tenaciously, losing at every 
        step but always in such a way that the decision was forced to be as broad 
        as possible, and then carrying it by way of appeals to the World Court.<br>
        It took years, and millions of dollars.<br>
        When the final decision was handed down, DeLong held what amounted to 
        a victory celebration over the legal loss. Andrew was, of course, present 
        in the company offices on the occasion.<br>
        &quot;We've done two things, Andrew,&quot; said DeLong, &quot;both of 
        which are good. First of all, we have established the fact that no number 
        of artificial parts in the human body causes it to cease being a human 
        body. Secondly, we have engaged public opinion in the question in such 
        a way as to put it fiercely on the side of a broad interpretation of humanity, 
        since there is not a human being in existence who does not hope for prosthetics 
        if they will keep him alive.&quot;<br>
        &quot;And do you think the Legislature will now grant me my humanity?&quot; 
        Andrew asked.<br>
        DeLong looked faintly uncomfortable. &quot;As to that, I cannot be optimistic. 
        There remains the one organ which the World Court has used as the criterion 
        of humanity. Human beings have an organic cellular brain and robots have 
        a platinum iridium positronic brain if they have one at all- and you certainly 
        have a positronic brain. No, Andrew, don't get that look in your eye. 
        We lack the knowledge to duplicate the work of a cellular brain in artificial 
        structures close enough to the organic type as to allow it to fall within 
        the court's decision. Not even you could do it.&quot;<br>
        &quot;What should we do, then?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Make the attempt, of course. Congresswoman Li-hsing will be on our 
        side and a growing number of other congress people. The President will 
        undoubtedly go along with a majority of the Legislature in this matter.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Do we have a majority?&quot;<br>
        &quot;No. Far from it. But we might get one if the public will allow its 
        desire for a broad interpretation of humanity to extend to you. A small 
        chance, I admit; but if you do not wish to give up, we must gamble for 
        it.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I do not wish to give up.&quot; </p>
      <p><br>
        20</p>
      <p> Congresswoman Li-hsing was considerably older than she had been when 
        Andrew had first met her. Her transparent garments were long gone. Her 
        hair was now close-cropped and her coverings were tubular. Yet still Andrew 
        clung, as closely as he could within the limits of reasonable taste, to 
        the style of clothing that had prevailed when he had first adopted clothing 
        more than a century before.<br>
        &quot;We've gone as far as we can, Andrew,&quot; Li-hsing admitted. &quot;We'll 
        try once more after recess, but, to be honest, defeat is certain and then 
        the whole thing will have to be given up. All my most recent efforts have 
        only earned me certain defeat in the coming congressional campaign.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I know,&quot; said Andrew, &quot;and it distressed me. You said 
        once you would abandon me if it came to that. Why have you not done so?&quot;<br>
        &quot;One can change one's mind, you know. Somehow, abandoning you became 
        a higher price than I cared to pay for just one more term. As it is, I've 
        been in the Legislature , for over a quarter of a century. It's enough.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Is there no way we can change minds, Chee?&quot;<br>
        &quot;We've changed all that are amenable to reason. The rest- the majority- 
        cannot be moved from their emotional antipathies.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Emotional antipathy is not a valid reason for voting one way or 
        the other.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I know that, Andrew, but they don't advance emotional antipathy 
        as their reason.&quot;<br>
        &quot;It all comes down to the brain, then,&quot; Andrew said cautiously. 
        &quot;But must we leave it at the level of cells versus positrons? Is 
        there no way of forcing a functional definition? Must we say that a brain 
        is made of this or that? May we not say that a brain is something- anything- 
        capable of a certain level of thought?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Won't work,&quot; said Li-hsing. &quot;Your brain is manmade, the 
        human brain is not. Your brain is constructed, theirs developed. To any 
        human being who is intent on keeping up the barrier between himself and 
        a robot, those differences are a steel wall a mile high and a mile thick.&quot;<br>
        &quot;If we could get at the source of their antipathy, the very source-&quot;<br>
        &quot;After all your years,&quot; Li-hsing said, sadly, &quot;you are 
        still trying to reason out the human being. Poor Andrew, don't be angry, 
        but it's the robot in you that drives you in that direction.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I don't know,&quot; said Andrew. &quot;If I could bring myself-&quot; 
      </p>
      <p><br>
        1 (Reprise)</p>
      <p> If he could bring himself-<br>
        He had known for a long time it might come to that, and in the end he 
        was at the surgeon's. He had found one, skillful enough for the job at 
        hand- which meant a surgeon- robot, for no human surgeon could be trusted 
        in this connection, either in ability or in intention.<br>
        The surgeon could not have performed the operation on a human being, so 
        Andrew, after putting off the moment of decision with a sad line of questioning 
        that reflected the turmoil within himself, had put First Law to one side 
        by saying &quot;I, too, am a robot.&quot;<br>
        He then said, as firmly as he had learned to form the words even at human 
        beings over these past decades, &quot;I order you to carry through the 
        operation on me.&quot;<br>
        In the absence of the First Law, an order so firmly given from one who 
        looked so much like a man activated the Second Law sufficiently to carry 
        the day. </p>
      <p><br>
        21</p>
      <p> Andrew's feeling of weakness was, he was sure, quite imaginary. He had 
        recovered from the- operation. Nevertheless, he leaned, as unobtrusively 
        as he could manage, against the wall. It would be entirely too revealing 
        to sit.<br>
        Li-hsing said, &quot;The final vote will come this week, Andrew. I've 
        been able to delay it no longer, and we must lose. And that will be it, 
        Andrew.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I am grateful for your skill at delay. It gave me the time I needed, 
        and I took the gamble I had to.&quot;<br>
        &quot;What gamble is this?&quot; Li-hsing asked with open concern.<br>
        &quot;I couldn't tell you, or even the people at Feingold and Martin. 
        I was sure I would be stopped. See here, if it is the brain that is at 
        issue, isn't the greatest difference of all the matter of immortality. 
        Who really cares what a brain looks like or is built of or how it was 
        formed. What matters is that human brain cells die, must die. Even if 
        every other organ in the body is maintained or replaced, the brain cells, 
        which cannot be replaced without changing and therefore killing the personality, 
        must eventually die.<br>
        &quot;My own positronic pathways have lasted nearly two centuries without 
        perceptible change, and can last for centuries more. Isn't that the fundamental 
        barrier: human beings can tolerate an immortal robot, for it doesn't matter 
        how long a machine lasts, but they cannot tolerate an immortal human being 
        since their own mortality is endurable only so long as it is universal. 
        And for that reason they won't make me a human being.&quot;<br>
        &quot;What is it you're leading up to, Andrew?&quot; Li-hsing asked.<br>
        &quot;I have removed that problem. Decades ago, my positronic brain was 
        connected to organic nerves. Now, one last operation has arranged that 
        connection in such a way that slowly- quite slowly- the potential is being 
        drained from my pathways.&quot;<br>
        Li-hsing's finely wrinkled face showed no expression for a moment. Then 
        her lips tightened. &quot;Do you mean you've arranged to die, Andrew? 
        You can't have. That violates the Third Law.&quot;<br>
        &quot;No,&quot; said Andrew, &quot;I have chosen between the death of 
        my body and the death of my aspirations and desires. To have let my body 
        live at the cost of the greater death is what would have violated the 
        Third Law.&quot;<br>
        Li-hsing seized his arm as though she were about to shake him. She stopped 
        herself. &quot;Andrew, it won't work! Change it back.&quot;<br>
        &quot;It can't be done. Too much damage was done. I have a year to live 
        more or less. I will last through the two-hundredth anniversary of my 
        construction. I was weak enough to arrange that.&quot;<br>
        &quot;How can it be worth it? Andrew, you're a fool.&quot;<br>
        &quot;If it brings me humanity, that will be worth it. If it doesn't, 
        it will bring an end to striving and that will be worth it, too.&quot;<br>
        Then Li-hsing did something that astonished herself. Quietly, she began 
        to weep. </p>
      <p><br>
        22</p>
      <p> It was odd how that last deed caught the imagination of the world. All 
        that Andrew had done before had not swayed them. But he had finally accepted 
        even death to be human, and the sacrifice was too great to be rejected.<br>
        The final ceremony was timed, quite deliberately, for the two hundredth 
        anniversary. The World President was to sign the act and make the people's 
        will law. The ceremony would be visible on a global network and would 
        be beamed to the Lunar state and even to the Martian colony.<br>
        Andrew was in a wheelchair. He could still walk, but only shakily.<br>
        With mankind watching, the World President said, &quot;Fifty years ago, 
        you were declared The Sesquicentennial Robot, Andrew.&quot; After a pause, 
        and in a more solemn tone, he continued, &quot;Today we declare you The 
        Bicentennial Man, Mr. Martin.&quot;<br>
        And Andrew, smiling, held out his hand to shake that of the President. 
      </p>
      <p><br>
        23</p>
      <p> Andrew's thoughts were slowly fading as he lay in bed. Desperately he 
        seized at them. Man! He was a man!<br>
        He wanted that to be his last thought. He wanted to dissolve- die with 
        that.<br>
        He opened his eyes one more time and for one last time recognized Li-hsing, 
        waiting solemnly. Others were there, but they were only shadows, unrecognizable 
        shadows. Only Li-hsing stood out against the deepening gray.<br>
        Slowly, inchingly, he held out his hand to her and very dimly and faintly 
        felt her take it.<br>
        She was fading in his eyes as the last of his thoughts trickled away. 
        But before she faded completely, one final fugitive thought came to him 
        and rested for a moment on his mind before everything stopped.<br>
        &quot;Little Miss,&quot; he whispered, too low to be heard. </p>
