<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Monferrato is one of the historical
regions of the Piedmont, from the
borders not very defined, mostly contained in the Alessandria and Asti
province.<br>
This territory is mainly hilly and there is a production of famous
wines (Barbera, Grignolino and so on).<br>
Monferrato was a contended region during the Middle Ages since to the
modern Age.<br>
A remarkable series of castles and fortifications were erected and they
are a great expression of the powerful marquises of the Monferrato and
their feudal system.<br>
In the 1500's, with the extinction of the Paleologi's dynasty, the
autonomy of the marquisate stopped. The dominion of the territory was
held by Gonzaga, with alternate vicissitudes. <br>
Since the beginning of the 1700's Monferrato was finally transferred to
the Savoia's control.<br>
In the 1800 Napoleon won in Marengo one of its most famous battles,
during the Italy campaign; in the 1800's Monferrato was theatre of the
Italian Risorgimento Motions, taking part with its men to the unit of
Italy.<br>
Monferrato just in recent years has been valued from the naturalistic
point of view.&nbsp;&nbsp; On foot, but also by bike or by horse, long
walks on paths between vine-lands, fields and forests are fantastic!!!<br>
Monferrato, is between the Italian regions notices for its
eno-gastronomia.<br>
It has history millenarian with artistic beauties from the Romanesque,
Gothic and Rinaissaince churches, castles, baroque monuments and
wonderful works of painters born here.<br>
Wine productions make of the Monferrato one of the most important
region&nbsp; in the Italian wine panorama. <br>
Grignolino, Freisa, Barbera, Moscato, Malvasia and Brachetto are ones
of the most famous wines in all over the world. The &#8220;gastronomia&#8221; is
rich of fantastic tastes. <br>
