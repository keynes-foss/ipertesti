<big><big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">CASTLES IN THE
PROVINCES OF
PARMA AND PIACENZA</span></big></big></big><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The territory of the provinces of
Parma and Piacenza, that the history
us delivery enclosed within the ancient borders of the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Ducato of the Farnese</span> and the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Borbone, </span>can be defined a "layer"
of castles.<br>
Culture, art and atmosphere, joined to a great enogastronomical
tradition, and constitute the essence of this earth laid between
Appennini and the Po, about an hour by car from Milan or half an hour
of flight from Rome. Castles and fortresses are to disposition of the
visitors long the roads that interlace the two Provinces, on the spurs
of mounts, between the necks that degrade towards the plain, in lands
close to the great Po river.<br>
Structures historical medieval, renaissance, baroque, judged one of the
richest and better conserved in Italy, offer the chance to understand
not only the architectonic evolution but the political and social one,
of these lands and Italy too.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Ducato is born in the 1545</span>,
with the election as Pope of the cardinal Alexander Farnese with the
name of Paul III, that it creates a state for the natural son Pier
Luigi.<br>
From then, until the Unit of Italy, for approximately 300 years the
representatives of the dynasties of the Farnese and the Borbone succeed
themselves to the government of the Ducato, until the Conference of
Vienna, when it is delivered to Maria Luigia of Austria, Napoleon's
wife. Who will visit the Castles of the Ducato will be able to read the
history of the powerful families that have inhabited them, of the great
artists who have worked, of the loves and the fights that have rendered
them so celebrated.<br>
