<big><big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE LOMBARDY REGION -
LAKE OF GARDA</span></big></big></big><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The busiest region in Italy; it
occupies the green Po Plain between the
Ticino and the Mincio Rivers, which with the Adda supply Lakes
Maggiore, Como and Garda. To the north the great lake valleys give
access to the Alpine passes.<br>
Lombardy, with the mulberry bushes of the Brianza district, takes first
place in the production of silk. The permanent grazing and grasslands
are used by a modern dairying industry. In the Lornellina district,
extensive areas are given over to rice growing.<br>
The many towns, scattered over the countryside, were important banking
and trading centres in medieval and Renaissance times and spread the
name of Lombards all over Europe. Today Como is the centre of the silk
industry, Brescia steel, chemical and engineering industries, Bergamo
textile and engineering works, Mantua petrochemicals and plastics,
Cremona agriculture and Pavia the seat of an important university.<br>
It is Milan, the economic capital of Italy, that has the highest
density of population and businesses. This town with its modern
architecture and numerous commercial enterprises and cultural
institutions has an outer ring of industrial suburbs which are the home
base of textile, oil, chemical, steel and food industries.<br>
Milan, where cooking is done with butter, gives its name to several
dishes:<br>
minestrone alla milanese, a soup of green vegetables, rice and bacon;
risotto alla milanese, rice cooked with saffron; costoletta alla
milanese, a fillet of veal fried in egg and bread-crumbs with cheese;
osso buco, a knuckle of veal with the marrow-bone; panettone, a large
fruit cake containing raisins and candied lemon peel. Here the
commonest cheese is again the excellent Gorgonzola. Few wines are
produced, apart from those of Valtellina or the Pavia district.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">7,8,9,10th DAY: VALTELLINA,
LIVIGNO</span><br>
This itinerary touches an extremely attractive valley as for landscapes
and for enviromental aspects, happy joining of typical ecosystems of
middle Europe and Mediterranean. We are in the part of Valtellina
including the valley formed by the Adda river, rich in majestic peaks
and wedging towards Switzerland. A large part of its territory belongs
to the National Stelvio Park and one of the best virtues of Vatellina
people is exactly the great respect for natural beauties.<br>
The High Valtellina is set in the heart of the Retiche Alps and
includes the municipalities of Bormio, Livigno, Sondalo, Valdidentro,
Valdisotto and Valfurva (all belonging to the Sondrio province). This
lands used to be called "Rezia" or "Magnifica Terra" (Marvellous Land)
because of the many and marvellous natural beauties. Now tourism,
mainly wintry, pours in the ski-area of Bormio, Santa Caterina, San
Colombano (Oga/Valdidentro), well-known for having hosted the Alpine
Ski World Championships and the finals of the Ski World Cup and many
international contests of straight race and "landlauf" ski. Here ski
can count upon high level lifts and slopes, many routes for Northerly
ski and evocative itineraries for Alpine-ski.<br>
Capital of High Valtellina and main centre is Bormio. Although it was
an ancient Roman village, some people say that its name would derive
from the German word "warm", in fact hot thermal waters spring in the
roundabouts of Bormio. Its old centre is very interesting thanks to the
ancient buildings that have been preserved and wisely restored. You
should not miss a visit in the botanic garden which will introduce you
to the plants species growing in the National Stelvio Park.<br>
Ski lovers should not miss the mythical Stelvio slope: 2.700-3.400
meters in the Stelvio glacier. This slope was invented in the occasion
of the World Championship of Alpine Ski and has hosted plenty of
contests in these years, above all straight race contests. But Stelvio
also means Stelvio Pass, the highest European pass (2.757 m.) well
known for the bikers' enterprises during the Giro d'Italia and as
training place for big champions.<br>
Bormio is also the gate to the National Stelvio Park, the largest in
Italy with 134.000 hectars, set in the heart of the central Alps and
including the whole Ortles-Cevedale massif and its lateral valleys. The
protected area borders North with the Swiss National Park of Engadina,
South with the Adamello Regional Park (it-self bordering with the
Adamello-Brenta Naturala Park). East it is separated by a few
kilometers from the Tessa Natural Park and West it borders with the
Livigno and Valdidentro Park that will be soon established by the
Lombardia Region.<br>
Last stage of our trip is Livigno: a village stretched in the
homonymous valley on the border line with Switzerland which became an
extra - customs zone because of its position for a long time isolated.
It has also been defined as "little Tibet" and it deserves this
comparison for the aboundance of snowfalls and the beauty of its
landscapes. Livigno is a paradise for people who cultivate the most
extreme and eccentric winter sports, from Alpine-ski to snow-board; but
it is above all the Italian capital for "telemark" a characteristic
speciality in which you have to ski on your knees and which is having a
new popularity in these last years. The amplitude of the valley allows
amusing rides also in winter months.<br>
