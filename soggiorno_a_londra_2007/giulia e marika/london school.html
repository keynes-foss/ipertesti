Our
school is very nice. Of this school we love our theacher, Kathy., and
the very
classrooms. It is a private school where people form others countries
go to
study English.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Taffy;">Our English
teacher&rsquo;s name
is Kathy and she is 34 years old.. She likes cats and, she explaned us
when she
was in New Zeland, she swam with some dolphins. She is tall and quite
slim. She
has straight, blond hair and big, light blue eyes. She has visited many
countries. Kathy is very unusual and funny and she is a very good
teacher.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Taffy;"><br>
<span style="">&nbsp;</span>Her favourite food is fish and chips
and her favourite drinks are cider and whisky. Her boyfriend&rsquo;s
name is Sunny
and he works near London. </span><span style="font-family: Taffy;"
 lang="EN-US">He comes from the east part of Asia. Kathy has four
father, this is an inusual situation, because her mother had married
and
divorcied many times.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With her we have taken part to many exercises and we
have
studied English in a funny way. </span><span
 style="font-family: Taffy;">When we
were in class we spoke a lot about our hobbys and we saw films in
English.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Taffy;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Taffy;">&nbsp; The
school in England
is more pleasant than the Italian school because it starts at 9:30 and
it
finishes at 13:00.<br>
We think that this experience has been really funny and we hope that we
will
have the opportunity to learn the local language this way in others
countries
like in London. We are very happy to have had the possibility to study
at the
Swandean School of English in a interesting way like this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
