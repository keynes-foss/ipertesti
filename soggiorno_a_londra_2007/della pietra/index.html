<span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">The
structure of our week in London was like this:</span></font></font></div>

<font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">from
Monday to Friday we went to school from 9:30 to 13:00. When the</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">school
finished we had a short time for eating and then we went</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2"><span lang="en-GB">sightseeing
with our teachers until about 17:00. After that we went home for
dinner and about 20:15 we</span></font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2"><span lang="en-GB">went
out until 22:30. On Saturday we went sightseeing in the</span></font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">morning
and in the afternoon we were free. On Sunday we visited Tower</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2"><span lang="en-GB">Bridge
in the morning and in the afternoon we came back home in Bologna.</span></font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: left; font-family: Century Gothic;" lang="en-GB"><font size="2">The
name of our school was &ldquo;Swandean school&rdquo; and it was
situated in</font><font size="2"> Wimbledon.
It was a school for foreigners. Our class name was &ldquo;Keynes</font>
<font size="2">Group&rdquo;
and we were in room 9.</font>
<font size="2">Our
teacher&rsquo;s name was Kathy and she was 34 years old. She was quite
tall</font>
<font size="2">and
slim with long straight blond hair and blue eyes. Her boyfriend&rsquo;s
name</font>
<font size="2"><span lang="en-GB">was
<span style="background: rgb(255, 255, 255) none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;">Sunny</span>.
He was Indian and he
worked in Wales. Kathy hadn&rsquo;t got any pets</span></font>
<font size="2">but
her favourite animal was the cat. Her favourite food was fish and</font>
<font size="2"><span lang="en-GB">chips
while she didn&rsquo;t like to eat rice. She told us something about</span></font>
<font size="2">her
experiences like when she went to Australia and she swam with</font>
<font size="2"><span lang="en-GB">dolphins.
She told us that she had been to 30 countries. Her lessons were</span></font>
<font size="2">very
pleasant and in a week we learnt a lot of things. One of my favourite</font>
<font size="2">part
of the lesson was the pronunciation: one day we repeated the</font>
<font size="2"><span lang="en-GB">alphabet
and another day we trained about the pronunciation of the h. On the</span></font>
<font size="2">last
day we watched the film &ldquo;Dodge ball&rdquo; with the subtitles in
English. I</font>
<font size="2">liked
it a lot, even if I didn&rsquo;t understand all the words. I felt very</font>
<font size="2"><span lang="en-GB">well
about the teacher, the lessons and the school and in my opinion it
was one</span></font>
<font size="2">of
the most interesting experiences that we did.</font> <br>

<br>

On
the 1st day we visited Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery.
After</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">that
we went to St. James&rsquo;s Park and to Buckingham Palace. This is one
my</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">favourite
monuments but I felt upset because we didn&rsquo;t see the changing of</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">the
guard, which is in the morning.</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">On
Monday we went for a walk in Wimbledon and after that we visited the</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">Museum
of London. I <br>

</font></font><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2"><span lang="en-GB"></span></font></font><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">didn&rsquo;t like it very much because,</font></font><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2"><span lang="en-GB"></span></font></font><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2"><span lang="en-GB"></span></font></font><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2"> in my opinion, it</font></font><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2"><span lang="en-GB"></span></font></font><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">wasn&rsquo;t
very interesting. On Tuesday we visited the Natural History Museum</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2"><span lang="en-GB">and
the Science Museum. I liked the 1st museum a lot, while I didn&rsquo;t
like the</span></font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">2nd
museum.</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;"> <br>

The Natural History Museum<br>

<br>

On
Wednesday we went to the Royal Observatory and the Maritime Museum.
We</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2"><span lang="en-GB">also
went to the Queen&rsquo;s House and the Cutty Sark but they were closed.</span></font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">On
Thursday we visited the Tower of London and I liked it so and so.</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">On
Friday we visited The Globe and the Clink Prison Museum. In my
opinion</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">this
was the worst museum that we visited. On Saturday morning we visited</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">the
British Museum and I liked it a lot. Afterwards we went to Covent</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">Garden
and there, there were a lot of interesting shops. In the afternoon</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">we
saw the Big Ben, Westminster Hall and Whitehall. On the last day we</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">visited
Tower Bridge and I liked it a lot.<br>

</font></font><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2"><span lang="en-GB">My
host family was composed of a mother and her son. The lady&rsquo;s name
was</span></font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">Lucia
Genevie while her son&rsquo;s name was Ashanti. Lucia was born in</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">Yorkshire
and she had lived there for 2 years. She was 42 years old and</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">she
was short and slim with long brown curly hair and dark brown eyes.
She</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">was
a very nice and generous person. She worked as a project</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">officer
and used to work near Tower Bridge. In her free-time she liked</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2"><span lang="en-GB">reading,
cooking, going to the theatre and to restaurants. She had been to</span></font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2"><span lang="en-GB">Italy
and she had visited Ravenna, Rimini, Bologna and Florenz. Ashanti</span></font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2"><span lang="en-GB">was
sixteen years old and he went to boarding school in Surrey. I
didn&rsquo;t
see him a</span></font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">lot
because he came back home only at week-ends. I felt very well with my</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">host
family even if the house was very small.<br>

<br>

The landlady of me and Michela<br>

<br>

</font></font><font size="2"><span lang="en-GB">The
weather in London was always sunny except on the last day which
became</span></font><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2"><span lang="en-GB">very
windy and rainy at about midday.</span></font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><br>

<font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">One
of the things of London that I didn&rsquo;t like very much were the
prices:</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2"><span lang="en-GB">for
example I paid 9 pounds (13.50 euros)for one pizza
&ldquo;Margherita&rdquo;!!
another thing</span></font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">that
I didn&rsquo;t like very much was the food. Fortunately in front of the</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">school
there was a shop called &ldquo;Panetteria Italiana&rdquo; where there
was
also</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">Italian
food. In the evening our landlady cooked quite well but the</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2">sandwiches
that she prepared for me and Michela weren&rsquo;t very good.</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2"><br>

However
I&rsquo;m very happy about our experience in London and in the future</font></font><span style="font-family: Century Gothic;">
</span><font style="font-family: Century Gothic;" face="Courier New, monospace"><font size="2"><span lang="en-GB">I
want to have a similar one!</span></font></font>
