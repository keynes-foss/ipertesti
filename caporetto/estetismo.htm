  In the 1848 poet and painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828-1882) found in
  England the pre-Raphaelite movement, than a return to the nature in vaguely
  mystical shapes is proposed, inspired to the New Style and the painting of
  the " primitives " (between the gothic and the humanism). Very beyond the
  pre-Raphaelites pleasure the three maximums are pushed exponents of the decaying
  aestheticism English.

  The first one, Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837-1909) arouses scandal with
  the collection Poems and Ballads in which turbid sexiness exalts one, fed
  from an exciting concoction of very cursed sadism.

  The second, Walter Pater (1839-1894), author of works literarily refined
  to which Marius the Epicurean (1885), Imaginary Portraits (1887), The Child
  in the House (1894), revisits the Renaissance in hedonism and aestheticism
  key (The Renaissance,1873), and embrace the " theory of the art for the art
  ", contra mail polemically to heavy the Victorian morals.

  The third party, <A HREF="wilde.htm" TARGET="centro">Oscar Wilde</A>, agree
  with Pater and, in total consonance with the dominant aestheticism, it
  demonstrates also to have made treasure of the lesson of Swinburne in a
  collection of poetical reflections from the Intentions title (Intentions,
  1891), where it writes: " With the Art and for the Art we Only can carry
  out our perfection and defender from filthy the dangers of the real life.
  Music is the perfect type of the Art, because it cannot never reveal its
  last secret. The Art never does not express null' same other if not if. The
  Life imitates the Art, more than this it does not imitate that one ".
