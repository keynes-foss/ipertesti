  Oscar Wilde was born in 1854 and grew up in an intellectually bustling Irish
  household. His mother was a poet who wrote under the pen name Speranza and
  who had a considerable following; his father was a renowned physician with
  an interest in myths and folklore.
</H4>
<H4 ALIGN=Justify>
  At Oxford he won a coveted poetry award and came under the influence of the
  late nineteenth century aesthetic movement. He found its notions of "art
  for art's sake" and dedicating one's life to art suitable to his temperment
  and talents. Oscar had a desire to make himself famous and set off to London
  to do just that.
</H4>
<H4 ALIGN=Justify>
  From 1878 to 1881 Oscar Wilde became well known for being well known despite
  having any substantial acheivements to build on. He insinuated himself into
  the class of people he labelled as "the beautiful people", wore outrageous
  clothes, passed himself off as an art critic and aesthete, and built a reputation
  for saying shocking things and doing ammusing ones. If one tells the truth,
  one is sure sooner or later to be found out. His natural wit and good humour
  endeared him to the art and theatre world and through his lover Frank Miles
  he found easy entry into the cliques that frequented London's theater circuit
  and drawing rooms.
</H4>
<H4 ALIGN=Justify>
  He became a much-desired all-purpose party guest and, with his velvet coat,
  knee breeches, silk stockings, pale green tie, cane, shoulder-length hair,
  loose silk shirts and the lily he occasionally carried through Picadilly
  Circus, much talked about and satirized. His popularity and flamboyance led
  to his being choosen as an advance publicity man for a new Gilbert and Sullivan
  operetta, Patience, that spoofed aesthetes like himself, and which paid him
  one third of the box office receipts.
</H4>
<H4 ALIGN=Justify>
  In 1882 he arrived in New York City and began a year long tour of North America.
  When a customs inspector asked him if he had anything to declare he replied,
  "Nothing but my genius." At 28 he lectured in 70 American and Canadian cities
  on the arts and literature. His performances were as wildly popular as his
  audiences were varied: he spoke to Mormons in Salt Lake City, silver miners
  in Colorado, West Coast literati in San Francisco, farmers in Kansas, and
  swung through Ontario and Quebec.
</H4>
<H4 ALIGN=Justify>
  When he returned from America he had tired of being the Great Aesthete and
  returned to more conventional dress. He toured, wrote two unsuccesful plays
  and a well received collection of children's fairy tales, married, fathered
  two sons and took a position as editor of Woman's World, a monthly magazine
  for which he wrote literary citicism. Two years later he tired of journalism
  and jornalists and returned to sparkling at parties and spending much of
  his time with friends and lovers, often stepping beyond the bounds of what
  was considered morally and socially proper for the time.
</H4>
<H4 ALIGN=Justify>
  From 1890 to 1895 Oscar Wilde reached the peak of his career, both as
  poet-playwright and social gadfly. His novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray
  raised a storm of indignation to thinly veiled allusions to the protagonist's
  homosexuality. In the same year he came out with a well received volume of
  children's stories, The House of Pomegranates and followed with a succession
  of enormously succesful plays that reintroduced the comedy of manners to
  the English Stage: Lady Windermere's Fan, A Woman of No Importance, and The
  Importance of Being Ernest, the latter being hailed as the first modern comedy
  in English.
</H4>
<H4 ALIGN=Justify>
  Wilde's plays served as a catalyst in creating the modern era. Collectively
  they "forced Victorian society to re-examine its hypocrisies and delineated
  with wit and humour, the arbitrariness of many moral and social taboos which,
  to the unreflective Victorian eye, appeared to be eternal.
</H4>
<H4 ALIGN=Justify>
  In 1895 the eigth Marquess of Queensberry, considered quite mad by even members
  of his immediate family, culminated his persistent public harassment of Wilde
  for his off-and-on sexual relationship with his son Lord Alfred Douglas.
  A libel suit filed by Wilde against the Marquess backfired; the Marquess
  was acquitted and Wilde's not too well camouflaged desire for men landed
  him two years of hard labour. Wilde resisted the urgings of his friends to
  leave for the Continent, where more tolerant sexual mores prevailed, saying
  he should accept with dignity the consequences of his actions. The supreme
  vice is shallowness.
</H4>
<H4 ALIGN=Justify>
  While in prison he wrote a 30,000 word letter to Douglas, published after
  his death with the title De Profundis, that is regarded as possibly being
  his most important and mature statement on life and art in general and his
  own life and art in particular. In concluding, he tells Douglas, You came
  to me to learn the Pleasures of Life and the Pleasures of Art. Perhaps I
  am chosen to teach you something much more wonderful, the meaning of Sorrow,
  and its beauty.
</H4>
<H4 ALIGN=Justify>
  After his release from prison, Wilde left England and wandered around Europe
  for the last three years of his life. He was a broken man who sank deeper
  into a reckless life of sex and absinthe which neither he nor long-time friends
  could extricate him. His one noteworthy piece from this period is The Ballad
  of Reading Gaol, a gripping account of prison brutality based on his own
  harrowing experiences with a plea for prison reform.
</H4>
<H4 ALIGN=Justify>
  He endured his final days in poor health and living on borrowed money and
  the kindness of sympathetic friends and hotel managers. In 1900, in Hotel
  d'Alsace in Paris, he died of cerebral meningitis.
