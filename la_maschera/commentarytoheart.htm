<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The main story of Heart of Darkness is encompassed in a framing story told by an unnamed narrator about how Marlow told his story to a group of men on a boat on the Thames
estuary. Thus, Heart of Darkness is on one level the story of the telling of a story.
And here begins Conrad's game of puzzling with memories and fantasy.</p>
<p> The theme of <b> communication </b> and<b> speech </b> is an important one to Heart of
Darkness, making the framing story an important aspect of the novel. The question of the
<i> reliability</i> of sources comes up again and again in the book, and Marlow is
isn't exempt from <i> suspicion</i>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> No one</b> except Marlow <b> is named </b> in the framing story; like many other characters in the book, they are identified only by
<i> their jobs </i>(accountant, lawyer, etc.) In the framing story, this gives them an aura of being somehow symbolic, as their identity comes from their position in society.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/congo.jpg" align="right" width="245" height="324"><br>
The theme of <b>civilization</b> versus <b> savagery</b> is central to Heart of
Darkness, and begins developing almost immediately. Marlow's assertion that England was once one of the dark places of the earth introduces
this explicitly, although the narrator touches on it earlier with his discussion of the Thames as a gateway of explorers and ambassadors of
civilization.&nbsp;</p>
<p> It also introduces the closely related theme of <b> light</b> versus <b>dark</b>,
and <b> white</b> versus <b>black</b>. Light and dark have traditionally represented good and evil
respectively, and <i> civilization</i> has generally been viewed as <i> good </i> while
<i> savagery</i> has normally been seen as<i> evil</i> (with extremely notable
exceptions, of course). So the city, the symbol of civilization, always forms a contrast with its
surroundings, instead of as some great symbol of light and culture.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Marlow's tale has no clear meaning</b>, even to him, and he struggles throughout to decipher some meaning in his
experiences. This <b> influences his method</b> of discourse, which is sometimes disjointed and
tangential, as one thought leads to another without strict regard to chronology.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Marlow describes his journey on several occasions as one of <b>self</b>-<b>discovery</b>. His narrative has a certain
<i> dreamlike quality</i> about it, and his story and its individual components possess an importance that lies hidden beneath the
surface.<br>
It seems to carry some meaning for him to interpret.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Marlow hesitates before embarking on his journey and has the strange feeling that he's
going at the <i> center of a continent</i>, but at the <i> center of the earth</i>. In the end,
<b> it becomes</b> apparent that his <i> real journey</i> has been to the center of the
<b> human spirit</b>.<br>
