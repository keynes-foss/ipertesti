<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>John is the son of two
members of Utopia, but has grown up on a Savage Reservation. He is the
only character who can really compare the two different worlds, and it
is through him that Huxley shows that his Utopia is a bad one. John's mother,
Linda, became pregnant accidentally, a very unusual event in the brave
new world. While she was pregnant, she visited a Savage Reservation, hurt
herself in a fall, and got lost, missing her return trip to London. The
Indians of the Reservation saved her life and she gave birth to John. The
boy grew up absorbing three cultures: the Utopia he heard about from his
mother; the Indian culture in which he lived, but which rejected him as
an outsider; and the plays of Shakespeare, which he read in a book that
survived from pre-Utopian days. John, in short, is different from the other
Savages and from the Utopians. He is tall and handsome, but much more of
an alien in either world than Bernard is. John looks at both worlds through
the lenses of the religion he acquired on the Reservation- a mixture of
Christianity and American Indian beliefs- and the old-fashioned morality
he learned from reading Shakespeare. His beliefs contradict those of the
brave new world, as he shows in his struggle over sex with Lenina and his
fight with the system after his mother dies. Eventually, the conflict is
too much for him and he kills himself.</font></font></b><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
