AND CONDITIONING</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>The Director opens the
novel by explaining the reproductive system of the brave new world, with
genetically engineered babies growing in bottles. He loves to throw "scientific
data" at his listeners so quickly that they can't understand them; he is
a know-it-all impressed with his own importance. In fact, he knows less
and is less important than the Controller, as you see when he is surprised
that the Controller dares to talk about two forbidden topics- history and
biological parents. The Director comes alive only when he confesses to
Bernard Marx that as a young man he went to a Savage Reservation, taking
along a woman who disappeared there. She was pregnant with his baby, as
a result of what the Utopia considers an obscene accident. The baby grows
up to be John; his return to London leads to the total humiliation of the
Director. The Director's name is Thomas, but you learn this only because
Linda, his onetime lover and John's mother, keeps referring to him as Tomakin.</font></font></b><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
