<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>Linda is John's mother,
a Beta minus who sleeps with the Director and becomes pregnant accidentally,
20 years before the action of the book begins. She falls while visiting
a Savage Reservation, becomes unconscious, and remains lost until the Director
has to leave. She is then rescued by Indians, gives birth to John, and
lives for 20 years in the squalor of the Reservation, where she grows old,
sick, and fat without the medical care that keeps people physically young
in the Utopia. Behaving according to Utopian principles, she sleeps with
many of the Indians on the Reservation and never understands why the women
despise her or why the community makes John an outcast. When she returns
to London, she takes ever-increasing doses of soma and stays perpetually
high- until the drug kills her.</font></font></b><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
