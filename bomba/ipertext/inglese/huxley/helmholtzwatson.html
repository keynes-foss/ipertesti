<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>Helmholtz, like Bernard,
is different from the average Alpha-plus intellectual. A mental giant who
is also successful in sports and sex, he's almost too good to be true.
But he is a nonconformist who knows that the world is capable of greater
literature than the propaganda he writes so well- and that he is capable
of producing it. When John the Savage introduces him to Shakespeare, Helmholtz
only appreciates half of it; despite his genius, he's still limited by
his Utopian upbringing. He remains willing to challenge society even if
he can't change it, and accepts exile to the bleak Falkland Islands in
the hope that physical discomfort and the company of other dissidents will
stimulate his writing</font></font></b><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
