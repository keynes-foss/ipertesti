<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>Setting plays a particularly
important role in Brave New World. Huxley's novel is a novel of Utopia,
and a science-fiction novel. In both kinds of books the portrayal of individual
characters tends to take a back seat to the portrayal of the society they
live in. In some ways, the brave new world itself becomes the book's main
character. The story opens in London some 600 years in the future- 632
A. F. (After Ford) in the calendar of the era. Centuries before, civilization
as we know it was destroyed in the Nine Years' War. Out of the ruins grew
the World State, an all-powerful government headed by ten World Controllers.
Faith in Christ has been replaced by Faith in Ford, a mythologized version
of Henry Ford, the auto pioneer who developed the mass production methods
that have reached their zenith in the World State. Almost all traces of
the past have been erased, for, as Henry Ford said, "History is bunk."
Changing names show the changed society. Charing Cross, the London railroad
station, is now Charing T Rocket Station: the cross has been supplanted
by the T, from Henry Ford's Model T. Big Ben is now Big Henry. Westminster
Abbey, one of England's most hallowed shrines, is now merely the site of
a nightclub, the Westminster Abbey Cabaret. The people of this world, born
from test tubes and divided into five castes, are docile and happy, kept
occupied by elaborate games like obstacle golf, entertainments like the
"feelies," and sexual promiscuity. Disease is nonexistent, old age and
death made as pleasant as possible so they can be ignored. Some parts of
the earth, however, are allowed to remain as they were before the World
State came to power. With Bernard and Lenina, you visit one of these Savage
Reservations, the New Mexican home of the Zuni Indians. It is a world away
from civilized London: the Zunis are impoverished, dirty, ravaged by disease
and old age, and still cling to their ancient religion. The settings in
Brave New World, then, seem to offer only the choice between civilized
servitude and primitive ignorance and squalor. Are these the only choices
available? One other is mentioned, the islands of exile- Iceland and the
Falkland Islands- where malcontents like Bernard Marx and Helmholtz Watson
are sent. But Huxley does not discuss these places in enough detail to
let us know whether or not they provide any kind of alternative to the
grim life he has presented in the rest of the book.</font></font></b><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
