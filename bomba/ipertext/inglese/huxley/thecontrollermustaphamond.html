MOND</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>Mond is one of the ten
people who control the World State. He is good-natured and dedicated to
his work, and extremely intelligent; he understands people and ideas that
are different, which most Utopians cannot do. He has read such forbidden
books as the works of Shakespeare and the Bible, and knows history and
philosophy. Indeed, he resembles the Oxford professors that Huxley knew,
and his discussion of happiness with the Savage resembles a tutorial between
an Oxford don and his most challenging student. Once a gifted scientist,
the Controller made a conscious choice as a young man to become one of
the rulers instead of a troublesome dissident. He is one of the few Utopians
who can choose, who has free will, and this makes him more rounded and
more attractive than most of the characters you'll meet in the book. It
also makes him concerned with morality, but he uses his moral force and
his sanity for the immoral and insane goals of the Utopia. You may decide
that he is the most dangerous person in Brave New World. - BERNARD MARX
A specialist in sleep-teaching, Bernard does not fit the uniformity that
usually characterizes all members of the same caste. He is an Alpha of
high intelligence and therefore a member of the elite, but he is small
and therefore regarded as deformed. Other people speculate that too much
alcohol was put into his bottle when he was still an embryo. He dislikes
sports and likes to be alone, two very unusual traits among Utopians. When
he first appears, he seems to dislike casual sex, another departure from
the norm. He is unhappy in a world where everyone else is happy. At first
Bernard seems to take pleasure in his differentness, to like being a nonconformist
and a rebel. Later, he reveals that his rebellion is less a matter of belief
than of his own failure to be accepted. When he returns from the Savage
Reservation with John, he is suddenly popular with important people and
successful with women, and he loves it. Underneath, he has always wanted
to be a happy member of the ruling class. In the end, he is exiled to Iceland
and protests bitterly.</font></font></b><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
