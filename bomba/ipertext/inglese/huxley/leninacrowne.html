<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>Lenina is young and pretty
despite having lupus, an illness that causes reddish-brown blotches to
appear on her skin. She is, like Henry Foster, a happy, shallow citizen,
her one idiosyncracy is the fact that she sometimes spends more time than
society approves dating one man exclusively. Like all well-conditioned
citizens of the World State, Lenina believes in having sex when she wants
it. She can't understand that John avoids sex with her because he loves
her and does not want to do something that he thinks- in his old-fashioned,
part-Indian, part-Christian, part-Shakespearean way- will dishonor her.
She embodies the conflict he feels between body and spirit, between love
and lust. Lenina is more a cartoon character than a real person, but she
triggers John's emotional violence and provides the occasion for his suicide
when she comes to see him whip himself.</font></font></b><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
