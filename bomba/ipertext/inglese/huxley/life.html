<div class="huxbio_class"><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Aldous
Leonard Huxley was born on July 26, 1894, into a family that included some
of the most distinguished members of that part of the English ruling class
made up of the intellectual elite. Aldous' father was the son of Thomas
Henry Huxley, a great biologist who helped develop the theory of evolution.
His mother was the sister of Mrs. Humphrey Ward, the novelist; the niece
of Matthew Arnold, the poet; and the granddaughter of Thomas Arnold, a
famous educator and the real-life headmaster of Rugby School who became
a character in the novel Tom Brown's Schooldays.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Undoubtedly,
Huxley's heritage and upbringing had an effect on his work. Gerald Heard,
a longtime friend, said that Huxley's ancestry "brought down on him a weight
of intellectual authority and a momentum of moral obligations." Throughout
<i><a href="brawenewworld.htm">Brave
New World</a></i> you can see evidence of an ambivalent attitude toward
such authority assumed by a ruling class.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Like
the England of his day, Huxley's Utopia possesses a rigid class structure,
one even stronger than England's because it is biologically and chemically
engineered and psychologically conditioned. And the members of <i><a href="brawenewworld.htm">Brave
New World</a>'s</i> ruling class certainly believe they possess the right
to make everyone happy by denying them love and freedom.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Huxley's
own experiences made him stand apart from the class into which he was born.
Even as a small child he was considered different, showing an alertness,
an intelligence, what his brother called a superiority. He was respected
and loved--not hated--for these abilities, but he drew on that feeling
of separateness in writing <i><a href="brawenewworld.htm">Brave New World</a></i>.
Bernard Marx and Helmholtz Watson, both members of the elite class, have
problems because they're different from their peers. Huxley felt that heredity
made each individual unique, and the uniqueness of the individual was essential
to freedom. Like his family, and like the Alphas of <i><a href="brawenewworld.htm">Brave
New World</a></i>, Huxley felt a moral obligation--but it was the obligation
to fight the idea that happiness could be achieved through class-instituted
slavery of even the most benevolent kind.</font></font></font></b><img SRC="huxup.gif" BORDER=0 height=192 width=147 align=RIGHT>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Another
event that marked Huxley was his mother's death from cancer when he was
14. This, he said later, gave him a sense of the transience of human happiness.
Perhaps you can also see the influence of his loss in <i><a href="brawenewworld.htm">Brave
New World</a></i>. The Utopians go to great lengths to deny the unpleasantness
of death, and to find perpetual happiness. But the cost is very great.
By denying themselves unpleasant emotions they deny themselves deeply joyous
ones as well. Their happiness can be continued endlessly by taking the
drug soma by making love, or by playing Obstacle Golf, but this happiness
is essentially shallow. Standing in contrast to the Utopians are the Savages
on the Reservation in New Mexico: poor, dirty, subject to the ills of old
age and painful death, but, Huxley seems to believe, blessed with a happiness
that while still transient is deeper and more real than that enjoyed by
the inhabitants of London and the rest of the World State.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>When
Huxley was 16 and a student at the prestigious school Eton, an eye illness
made him nearly blind. He recovered enough vision to go on to Oxford University
and graduate with honors, but not enough to fight in World War I, an important
experience for many of his friends, or to do the scientific work he had
dreamed of. Scientific ideas remained with him, however, and he used them
in many of his books, particularly <i><a href="brawenewworld.htm">Brave
New World</a></i>. The idea of vision also remained important to him; his
early novels contain scenes that seem ideal for motion pictures, and he
later became a screenwriter.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>He
entered the literary world while he was at Oxford, meeting writers like
Lytton Strachey and Bertrand Russell and becoming close friends with D.
H. Lawrence, with whom you might think he had almost nothing in common.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Huxley
published his first book, a collection of poems, in 1916. He married Maria
Nys, a Belgian, in 1919. Their only child, Matthew Huxley, was born in
1920. The family divided their time between London and Europe, mostly Italy,
in the 1920s, and traveled around the world in 1925 and 1926, seeing India
and making a first visit to the United States.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Huxley
liked the confidence, vitality, and "generous extravagance" he found in
American life. But he wasn't so sure he liked the way vitality was expressed
"in places of public amusement, in dancing and motoring... Nowhere, perhaps,
is there so little conversation... It is all movement and noise, like the
water gurgling out of a bath--down the waste. Yes, down the waste." Those
thoughts of the actual world, from the book <i>Jesting Pilate</i>, were
to color his picture of the perpetual happiness attempted in <i>Brave New
World</i>.</font></font></font></b><img SRC="huxsmoking.jpg" BORDER=0 height=176 width=150 align=RIGHT>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>His
experiences in fascist Italy, where <a href="../../storia/mussolini.html">Benito
Mussolini</a> led an authoritarian government that fought against birth
control in order to produce enough manpower for the next war, also provided
materials for Huxley's bad Utopia, as did his reading of books critical
of the Soviet Union.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Huxley
wrote <i><a href="brawenewworld.htm">Brave New World</a></i> in four
months in 1931. It appeared three years after the publication of his best-seller,
the novel Point Counter Point. During those three years, he had produced
six books of stories, essays, poems, and plays, but nothing major. His
biographer, Sybille Bedford, says, "It was time to produce some full-length
fiction--he still felt like holding back from another straight novel--juggling
in fiction form with the scientific possibilities of the future might be
a new line."</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Because
<i><a href="brawenewworld.htm">Brave
New World</a></i> describes a bad Utopia, it is often compared with <a href="../orwell/gorwell.htm">George
Orwell's</a><i><a href="../orwell/1984plot.html">1984</a></i>, another
novel you may want to read, which also describes a possible horrible world
of the future. The world of <i><a href="../orwell/1984plot.html">1984</a></i>
is one of tyranny, terror, and perpetual warfare. Orwell wrote it in 1948,
shortly after the Allies had defeated Nazi Germany in World War II and
just as the West was discovering the full dimensions of the evils of Soviet
totalitarianism.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>It's
important to remember that Huxley wrote <i><a href="../orwell/gorwell.htm">Brave
New World</a></i> in 1931, before Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany
and before Joseph Stalin started the purges that killed millions of people
in the Soviet Union. He therefore had no immediate real-life reason to
make tyranny and terror major elements of his story. In 1958 Huxley himself
said, "The future dictatorship of my imaginary world was a good deal less
brutal than the future dictatorship so brilliantly portrayed by Orwell."</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>In
1937, the Huxleys came to the United States; in 1938 they went to Hollywood,
where he became a screenwriter (among his films was an adaptation of Jane
Austen's Pride and Prejudice, which starred the young Laurence Olivier).
He remained for most of his life in California, and one of his novels caricatures
what he saw as the strange life there: <i>After Many a Summer Dies the
Swan</i>. In it the tycoon Jo Stoyte tries to achieve immortality through
scientific experimentation, even if it means giving up humanity and returning
to the completely animal state--an echo of <i>Brave New World</i>.</font></font></font></b><img SRC="huxmovie.gif" BORDER=0 height=200 width=176 align=RIGHT>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>In
1946 Huxley wrote a Foreword to <i>Brave New World</i> in which he said
he no longer wanted to make social sanity an impossibility, as he had in
the novel. Though World War II had caused the deaths of some 20 million
inhabitants of the Soviet Union, six million Jews, and millions of others,
and the newly developed atomic bomb held the threat of even more extensive
destruction, Huxley had become convinced that while still "rather rare,"
sanity could be achieved and said that he would like to see more of it.
In the same year, he published
<i>The Perennial Philosophy</i>, an anthology
of texts with his own commentaries on mystical and religious approaches
to a sane life in a sane society.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>He
also worried about the dangers that threatened sanity. In 1958, he published
<i>Brave
New World Revisited</i>, a set of essays on real-life problems and ideas
you'll find in the novel--overpopulation, overorganization, and psychological
techniques from salesmanship to hypnopaedia, or sleep-teaching. They're
all tools that a government can abuse to deprive people of freedom, an
abuse that Huxley wanted people to fight. If you want to further relate
his bad new world to the real world, read <i>Brave New World Revisited</i>.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>In
the 1950s Huxley became famous for his interest in psychedelic or mind-expanding
drugs like mescaline and LSD, which he apparently took a dozen times over
ten years. Sybille Bedford says he was looking for a drug that would allow
an escape from the self and that if taken with caution would be physically
and socially harmless.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>He
put his beliefs in such a drug and in sanity into several books. Two, based
on his experiences taking mescaline under supervision, were nonfiction:
<i>Doors
of Perception</i> (1954) and <i>Heaven and Hell</i> (1956). Some readers
have read those books as encouragements to experiment freely with drugs,
but Huxley warned of the dangers of such experiments in an appendix he
wrote to The Devils of Loudun (1952), a psychological study of an episode
in French history.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Another
work centering on drugs and sanity was <i>Island</i> (1962), a novel that
required 20 years of thought and five years of writing. Among other things,
Island was an antidote to <i>Brave New World</i>, a good Utopia. Huxley
deplored the drug he called soma in <i>Brave New World</i>--half tranquilizer,
half intoxicant--which produces an artificial happiness that makes people
content with their lack of freedom. He approved of the perfected version
of LSD that the people of Island use in a religious way.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Huxley
produced 47 books in his long career as a writer. The English critic Anthony
Burgess has said that he equipped the novel with a brain. Other critics
objected that he was a better essayist than novelist precisely because
he cared more about his ideas than about plot or characters, and his novels'
ideas often get in the way of the story.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>But
Huxley's emphasis on ideas and his skin as an essayist cannot hide one
important fact: The books he wrote that are most read and best remembered
today are all novels--<i>Crome Yellow</i>, <i>Antic Hay</i>, and <i>Point
Counter Point</i> from the 1920s,
<i>Brave New World</i> and <i>After Many
a Summer Dies the Swan</i> from the 1930s. In 1959 the American Academy
of Arts and Letters gave him the Award of Merit for the Novel, a prize
given every five years; earlier recipients had been Ernest Hemingway, Thomas
Mann, and Theodore Dreiser.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>The
range of Huxley's interests can be seen from his note that his "preliminary
research" for
<i>Island</i> included "Greek history, Polynesian anthropology,
translations from Sanskrit and Chinese of Buddhist texts, scientific papers
on pharmacology, neurophysiology, psychology and education, together with
novels, poems, critical essays, travel books, political commentaries and
conversations with all kinds of people, from philosophers to actresses,
from patients in mental hospitals to tycoons in Rolls-Royces...." He used
similar, though probably fewer, sources for <i>Brave New World</i>.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>This
list gives you some perspective on the wide range of ideas that Huxley
studied. He also wrote an early essay on ecology that helped inspire today's
environmental movement. And he was a pacifist. This belief prevented him
from becoming an American citizen because he would not say his pacifism
was a matter of his religion, which might have made him an acceptable conscientious
objector.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Huxley
remained nearly blind all his life. Maria Huxley died in 1955, and Huxley
married Laura Archera a year later. He died November 22, 1963, the same
day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. He was cremated, and
his ashes were buried in his parents' grave in England.</font></font></font></b></div>
