<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>Doublethink is a kind of
manipulation of the mind. Generally one could say that Doublethink makes
people accept contradictions, and it makes them also believe, that, the
party is the only institution that distinguishes between right and wrong.
This manipulation is mainly done by the Minitrue (Ministry of Truth), where
Winston Smith works. When a person that is well grounded in Doublethink
recognizes a contradiction or a lie of the Party, then the person thinks
that he is remembering a false fact. The use of the word Doublethink involves
doublethink. With the help of the Minitrue it is not only possible to change
written facts, but also facts that are remembered by the people. So complete
control of the country and it's citizens is provided. The fact of faking
the history had already been used by the Nazis, who told the people that
already German Knights believed in the principles of National Socialism.</font></font></b><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
