<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>The Story starts, as the
title tells us, in the year of 1984, and it takes place in England or how
it is called at that time, Airstrip One. Airstrip One itself is the mainland
of a huge country, called Oceania, which consists of North America, South
Africa, and Australia. The country is ruled by the <a href="party.html">Party</a>,
which is led by a figure called <a href="bigbrother.html">Big Brother</a>.
The population of Oceania is divided into three parts:</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>1.The Inner Party (app.
1% of the population)</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>2.The Outer Party (app.
18% of the population)</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>3.The <a href="proles.html">Proles</a></font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>The narrator of the book
is all-knowing and he is not participating in the action of the book himself.
The protagonist is <a href="winston.html">Winston Smith</a>, a member of
the OuterParty, working in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth,
rewriting and altering records, such as newspaper-articles, of the past.
The action starts when Winston develops critic thoughts against the ruling
dictatorship of the party, for the first time. Doing so he buys himself
a book, a rare thing these days, to use it as a diary. As individual expression
was forbidden by the Party, having a diary was a crime, which could even
be punished with death. There were so-called telescreens in each room,
showing propaganda and political pamphlets, which had a built in camera
and microphone, in order to spy on the people. Therefore keeping a secret
book was not only forbidden, but also very dangerous. When Winston makes
the first entry in the diary ,he thinks about an experience he has made
during the Two Minutes Hate, a propaganda film, that was repeated each
day. During this Film he caught the eye of <a href="obrien.html">O'Brien</a>,
a member of the Inner Party, of whom he thought that he might alos stand
critic to the regime, or that at least there is a bond of some kind between
them. After the reflection, he finds that he has written the sentence :"Down
with Big Brother" all over the page. In the same night Winston dreams about,
his mother and sister, who had starved to death in the war, because he
had been so greedy. Then he dreams of having sex with a girl he has seen
in the Records Department, during the Two Minute Hate. Early in the morning
Winston is waken up by the harsh voice from the telescreen. During the
performance of the exercises, Winston's thoughts move back to his childhood.
The last thing he remembers clearly, is the World War. After the WW the
party has taken control of the country, and from then on it was difficult
to remember anything, because the party changed the history permanently
to their own benefit (see <a href="doublethink.html">Doublethink</a>).
After the exercises Winston goes to work, to the Minitrue (Ministry of
Truth), where his job is to alter records, and once altered, to throw them
into the Memory Hole where they are burnt. For example B.B. (Big Brother)
has promised that there will be no reduction of the chocolate ration, but
there has been one, so Winston has to rewrite an old article, where the
speech of B.B. is written down. At dinner Winston Smith meets Syme, a philologist,
who is working on the 11 th edition of The <a href="newspeak.html">Newspeak</a>
Dictionary, Syme explains the main character of their work on this dictionary.
During their conversation the telescreen announces that the chocolate ration
has been risen to 20 g a week, whereas yesterday it was cut down to 20
g a week.Winston wonders whether he's the only person with memory, that
isn't inflicted by Doublethink. As he looks around in the dining room he
catches the eye of the dark-haired girl he had dreamed the same night.
Back home again he makes an entry into his diary about his meeting with
a prostitute three years ago. He rememberes her ugliness, but nevertheless
he had sex with her. Winston had a wife, but she was very stupid and just
following the orders of the Party, which said that there may only be Sex
to produce "new material" for the Party, and that sex for the personal
pleasure is a crime. Then Winston thinks about the Party, and believes
that the only hope lies in the Proles who pose over 80% of Oceanias population.
Later he remembers another fact of his past, Jones, Aaronson and Rutherford,
the last three survivors of the original leaders of the Revolution. They
were arrested in 1965, and confessed all kind of sabotage on trial, they
were pardoned, reinstated but not long after were arrested again, and executed.
During the brief period Winston has seen them in the Chestnut Tree Cafe.
In the same year a half page torn out of The Times came to Winston trough
the transport tube in the Minitrue. This page of The Times showed the three
men in Eastasia on a certain day. But Winston remembered clearly that they
have confessed being in Eurasia on that day (At this time Eurasia was at
war with Oceania, and Eastasia was an allied). So Winston could proof that
the confessions were lies. But Winston had sent this paper down to the
Memory Hole (a kind of paper basket) The last entry Winston writes in his
diary is that freedom is to say that two and two makes four. If this is
granted everything else follows. The next day Winston decides not to participate
in the community actions, but to take a walk in the quarters of the Proles,
around St Pancras station. During the walk a Rocket-Bomb explodes nearby.
After a while Winston finds himself in front of the junk-shop, where he
has bought the diary. There he sees an old man just entering a pub. He
decides to follow the man, and to ask him about the time before the revolution,
but the old man has already forgotten nearly everything about this time,
except for some useless personal things. Winston leaves the pub and goes
to the Shop, where he finds a pink piece of glass with apiece of coral
inside which he buys. Mr Carrington, the owner of the shop leads him upstairs
to show him an old fashioned room. W. Smith likes the room because of its
warmth and of course because there are no telescreens. When Winston leaves
the shop he suddenly meets the dark-haired girl in the street. He now believes
that this girl is an amateur spy or even a member of the Thought Police,
spying on him. The next morning he meets the girl in the Ministry of Truth,
and in the moment she passes, she falls down and cries out in pain. When
Winston helps her up, she has presses a piece of paper into his hand. At
the first opportunity he opens it and finds the startling message: "I love
you" written on it. For a week he waits for an opportunity to speak with
her. Finally he is successful, and he meets her in the canteen where they
fix a meeting. Some time later they meet on the fixed place, there the
girl gives Winston precise instructions how to get to a secret place on
Sunday. It is Sunday and Winston is following the girl's directions. On
the way he picks some bluebells for her. And then finally she comes up
behind him, telling him to be quiet because there might be some microphones
hidden somewhere. They kiss and he learns her name: <a href="Julia.html">Julia</a>.
She leads him to another place where they cannot be observed. Before she
takes off her blue party-overall, Julia tells Winston that she is attracted
to him by something in his face which showes that he is against the party.
Winston is surprised and asks Julia if she has done such a thing before.
To his delight she tells him that she has done it scores of times, which
fills him with a great hope. Evidence of corruption and abandon always
gives him with hope. Perhaps the whole system is rotten, and will simply
crumb to pieces one day. The more men she had, the more he loves her, and
later as he looks at her sleeping body, he thinks that now even sex is
a political act, a blow against the falseness of the Party. Winston and
Julia arrange to meet again. Winston rents the room above Mr Carringtons
junk shop, a place where they can meet and talk without the fear of being
observed. It is summer and the preparations for "Hate Week", an enormous
propaganda event, are well forthcoming, and in this time Winston meets
Julia more often than ever before. Julia makes him feel more alive, she
makes him feel healthier, and he even puts on weight. One day O'Brien speaks
to Winston in the Ministry of Truth. He refers, obliquely to Syme, the
philologist, who has vanished a couple of days before, and is now, as it
is called in Newspeak an unperson. In doing so O'Brien is committing a
little act of thoughtcrime. O'Brien invites Winston to his flat, to see
the latest edition of the Newspeak dictionary. Winston now feels sure that
the conspiracy against the Party he had longed to know about - the Brotherhood,
as it is called - does exist, and that in the encounter with O'Brien he
has come into contact with its outer edge. He knows that he has embarked
on a course of action which will lead , in one way or another, to the cells
of the Ministry of Love. Some days later Winston and Julia meet each other
to go to the flat of O'Brien, which lies in the district of the Inner Party.
They are admitted to a richly furnitured room by a servant. To their astonishment
O'Brien switches off the Telescreen in the room.(Normally it is impossible
to turn it off) Winston blurts out why they have come: they want to work
against the Party, they believe in the existence of the Brotherhood, and
that O'Brien is involved with it. Martin, O'Brien's servant brings real
red vine, and they drink a toast to Emanuel Goldstein, the leader of the
Brotherhood. O'Brien asks them a series of questions about their willingness
to commit various atrocities on behalf of the Brotherhood and gets their
assent. They leave, and some days later Winston gets a copy of "The Book",
a book written by Emanuel Goldstein, about his political ideas. Now it
is Hate Week and suddenly the war with Eurasia stopps, and a war with Eastasia
starts. This of course meant a lot of work for Winston. He had to change
dozens of articles about the war with Eurasia. Nevertheless Winston finds
time to read the book. The book has three chapters titled, "War is Peace",
"Ignorance is Strength" and "Freedom is Slavery", which were also the main
phrases of the party. The main ideas of the book are:</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>1: War is important for
consuming the products of human labour, if this work would be used to increase
the standard of living, the control of the party over the people would
decrease. War is the economy basis for a hierarchical society.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>2: There is an emotional
need to believe in the ultimate victory of Big Brother.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>3: In becoming continuous
war has ceased to exist. The continuity of the war guarantees the permanence
of the current order. In other words "War is Peace"</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>4: There have always
been three main grades of society; the High, the Middle and the Low, and
no change has brought human equality a millimetre nearer.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>5: Collectivism doesn't
lead to socialism. In the event the wealth now belongs to the new "high-class",
the bureaucrats and administrators. Collectivism has ensured the permanence
of economic inequality.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>6: Wealth is not inherited
from person to person, but it is kept within the ruling group.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>7: The masses (proles)
are given freedom of thought, because they don't think! A Party member
is not allowed the slightest deviation of thought, and there is an elaborate
mental training to ensure this, a training that can be summarised in the
concept of doublethink.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>So far the book analyses
how the Party works. It has not yet attempted to deal with why the Party
has arisen. Before continuing with the next chapter Winston turns to Julia,
and finds her asleep. He also falls asleep. The next morning when he awakes
the sun is shining, and down in the yard a prole women is singing and working.
Winston is again filled with the conviction that the future lies with the
proles, that they will overthrow the greyness of the Party. But suddenly
reality crashes in. "We are the DEAD", he says to Julia. An iron voice
behind them repeats the phrase, the picture on the wall falls to bits to
reveal a telescreen behind it. Uniformed man thunder into the room and
they carry Winston and Julia out.Winston is in a cell in what he presumes
is the Ministry of Love. He is sick with hunger and fear, and when he makes
a movement or a sound, a harsh voice will bawl at him from the four telescreens.
A prisoner who is dying of starvation is brought in, his face is skull-like.
Later the man is brought to "Room 101" after screaming and struggling,
and even offering his children's sacrifices in his stead. O'Brien enters.
Winston thinks that they must have got him too, but O'Brien says that they
got him long time ago. A guard his Winston, and he becomes unconscious.
When he wakes up he is tied down to a kind of bed. O'Brien stands beside
the bed, and Winston feels that O'Brien, who is the torturer, is also somehow
a friend. The aim of O'Brien is to teach Winston the technique of Doublethink,
and he does it by inflicting pain in ever-increasing intensity. He reminds
Winston that he wrote the sentence:" Freedom is the freedom to say that
two plus two makes four". O'Brien holds up four fingers of his left hand,
and he asks Winston how many there are. Winston answers four a couple of
times, and each time the pain increases (this is not done to make Winston
lie, but to make him really see five fingers instead of four). At the end
of the session, under heavy influence of drugs and agony, Winston really
seas five fingers. Now Winston is ready to enter the second stage of his
integration (1. Learning, 2. Understanding, 3. Acceptance). O'Brien now
explains why the Party works. The image he gives of the future is that
of a boot stamping on a human face - for ever. Winston protests, because
he thinks that there is something in the human nature that will not allow
this, he calls it "The Spirit of Man". O'Brien points out that Winston
is the last humanist, he is the last guardian of the human spirit. Then
O'Brien gets Winston to look at himself in the mirror, Winston is horrified
what he sees. The unknown time of torture has changed him into a shapeless
and battered wreck. This is what the last humanist looks like. The only
degradation that Winston has not been trough, is that he has not betrayed
Julia. He has said anything under torture, but inside he has remained true
to her. Winston is much better now. For some time he has not been beaten
and tortured, he has been fed quite well and allowed to wash. Winston realises
that he now accepts all the lies of the Party, that for example Oceania
was always at war with Eastasia, and that he never had the photograph of
Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford that disproved their guilty. Even gravity
could be nonsense. But nevertheless Winston has some unorthodox thoughts
that he cannot suppress. But now it is time for the last of the three steps,
reintegration. Winston is taken to Room 101. O'Brien says that the room
101 is the worst thing in the world. For each person it is his own personal
hell. For some it is death by fire or burial alive. For Winston it is a
cage containing two rats, with a fixture like a fencing mask attached,
into which the face of the victim is strapped. Then there is a lever, that
opens the cage ,so that the rats can get to the face. O'Brien is approaching
nearer with the cage ,and Winston gets the bad smell of the rats. He screams.
The only way to get out of this is to put someone else between him and
the horror."Do it to Julia", he screams in a final betrayal of himself.
Winston is released, and he is often sitting in the Chestnut Tree Caf&eacute;,
drinking Victory Gin and playing chess. He now has a job in a sub-committee
, that is made up for others like himself. On a cold winter day he meets
Julia, they speak briefly, but have little to say to each other, except
that they have betrayed each other. A memory of a day in his childhood
comes to Winstons' mind; It is false, he is often troubled by false memories.
He looks forward to the bullet, they will kill him some day. Now he realises
how pointless it was to resist. He loves Big Brother!</font></font></b><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
