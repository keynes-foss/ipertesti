<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>Big Brother is not a real
person. All-present as he is, all-powerful and forever watching, he is
only seen on TV. Although his picture glares out from huge posters that
shout, BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, nobody sees Big Brother in person.
Orwell had several things in mind when he created Big Brother. He was certainly
thinking of Russian leader Joseph Stalin; the pictures of Big Brother even
look like him. He was also thinking of Nazi leader Adolph Hitler and Spanish
dictator Francisco Franco. Big Brother stands for all dictators everywhere.
Orwell may have been thinking about figures in certain religious faiths
when he drew Big Brother. The mysterious, powerful, God-like figure who
sees and knows everything- but never appears in person. For Inner Party
members, Big Brother is a leader, a bogeyman they can use to scare the
people, and their authorisation for doing whatever they want. If anybody
asks, they can say they are under orders from Big Brother. For the unthinking
proles, Big Brother is a distant authority figure. For Winston, Big Brother
is an inspiration. Big Brother excites and energises Winston, who hates
him. He is also fascinated by Big Brother and drawn to him in some of the
same ways that he is drawn to O'Brien, developing a love-hate response
to both of them that leads to his downfall.</font></font></b><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
