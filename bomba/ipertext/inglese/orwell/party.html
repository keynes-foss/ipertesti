<b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>The Party of Oceania poses
about 19% of the whole population of Oceanias mainland. Generally one could
divide the Party into the Inner Party, which is comparable to the communistic
Nomenclature, and the Outer Party. Winston Smith himself is a member of
the Outer Party. The members of the Inner Party hold high posts in the
administration of the country. They earn comparable much money, and there
isn't a lack of anything in their homes, which looked like palaces. The
people of the Outer Party live in dull grey and old flats. Because of the
war there is often a lack of the most essential things. The life of the
Outer Party is dictated by the Party, even their spare time is used by
the Party. There are so-called community hikes, community games and all
sort of other activities. And refusing the participation at this activities
is even dangerous. The life of a Party member is dictated from his birth
to his death. The Party even takes children away from their parents to
educate them in the sense of Ingsoc. (you can find this also in the Communist
future plans)The children are taught in school, to report it to the police
(Toughtpolice) when their parents have unorthodox thoughts, so-called "Thoughtcrimes".
After the education the Party members start to work mainly for one of the
four Ministries (Minipax, Minitrue, Miniluv, Miniplenty). The further life
of the "comrades" continues under the watchful eyes of the Party. Everything
the people do is targeted by the telescreens. Even in their homes people
have telescreens. Each unorthodox action is then punished by "joycamps"
(Newspeak word for forced labour camps").</font></font></b><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
