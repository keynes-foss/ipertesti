<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1><i>'All animals are equal,
but some animals are more equal than others.'
<hr></i>English novelist, essayist and critic famous for his novels <a href="animalfarm.html">ANIMAL
FARM</a> (1945) and <a href="1984plot.html">NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR</a> (1949)</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>Orwell was born in Motihari,
Bengal, India. His father was a civil servant in the opium departnment
and his mother came from a family of old Burma hands. In 1904 Orwell moved
with his mother and sister to England. He attended Eton, where he published
his first writings in college periodicals. During these years Orwell developed
his antipathy towards the English class systems. Also Orwell's preparatory
school years at St Cyprian's were not happy. His bitter essay SUCH, SUCH
WERE THE JOYS was not published until 1968.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>In 1922 Owell went to
Burma to serve in the Indian Imperial Police (1922-27) as an assistant
superintendent. Eventually Orwell's mounting dislike of imperialism led
to his resignation. His revelations of the behaviour of the colonial officers
appeared in SHOOTING AN ELEPHANT (1950) and in his early essay <i>A Hanging
</i>(1931).</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>Orwell returned to Europe,
and lived as a tramp and beggar, workinglow paid jobs, in England and France
(1928-29). His account of these experiences gave material for the DOWN
AND OUT IN PARIS AND LONDON (1933). From 1930 Orwell contributed regularly
to the <i>New Adelphi. </i>Unable to support himself with his writings
Orwell took up a teaching post at a private school, where he finished his
first novel, BURMESE DAYS (1934). In 1936 Orwell married Eileen O'Shaugnessy.
KEEP THE ASPIDISTRA FLYING, the story of a young bookseller's assistant,
appeared in 1936. From 1936 to 1940 Orwell worked as a shopkeeper in Wallingford,
Hertfordshire. In 1936 Orwell was commissioned by the publisher Victor
Gollancz to priduce a documentary account of unemployment in the North
of England for the Left Book Club. The result, THE ROAD TO WIGAN'S PEER,
is considered a milestone in modernliterary journalism.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>In the1930s Orwell had
adopted socialistic views and travelled to Spain to report on the Civil
War. He fought alongside the United Workers Marxist Party militia and was
wounded in the neck. The war made him strong opposer of communism and advocate
of English brand of socialism. Orwell's book on Spain, HOMAGE TO CATALONIA,
appeared in 1938.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>During <a href="../../storia/guerramondiale.html#inizio">World
War II</a> Orwell served as a sergeant in the Home Guard and worked as
a journalist for the BBC, <i>Observer</i> and <i>Tribune</i>, where he
was literary editor from 1943 to 1945. After the war Orwell lived mostly
in Jura in the Western Isles of Scotland.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>The biting satire of Communist
ideology in <i><a href="animalfarm.html">The Animal Farm</a></i> made
Orwell for the first time prosperous. His other world wide success was
<i><a href="1984plot.html">Nineteen
Eighty-Four</a></i>, one of the classical works of science fiction along
with
<a href="../huxley/life.html">Aldous
Huxley</a>'s
<i><a href="../huxley/brawenewworld.htm">Brave New World</a></i>
and H.G.Wells novels <i>Time Machine</i>,
<i>War of The World and Invisible
Man</i>. Orwell's wife died in 1945 and in 1949 he married Sonia Browell.
Suffering from tuberculosis Orwell died in London on January 21, 1950.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1>Although Orwell is best-known
as a novelis, his essays are among the finest of the 20th-century. He produced
also newspaper articles and reviews, which were written for money, but
carefully crafted his other essays for such journals as <i>Partisan Review</i>,
<i>Adelphi</i>
and <i>Horizon</i>. Orwell united political purpose and literary ambitions
into a sharp analysis of bureauctatic institutions and cultural elite.
Without hesititon he accused Yeats as a fascist, H.G. Wells is out of touch
with reality, Salvador Dali is found decadent, but defends P.G. Wodehouse
and rehabilitates Kilping. His view of the class bounded language has had
deep effect on the political discourse of our time.</font></font></b><b><i><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font size=+1><a href="Animal farm.html"></a></font></font></i></b>
